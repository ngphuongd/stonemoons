IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  2/3/97 BEGIN TIME:  13:31END TIME:  13:46FACILITATOR:  SarahThe mind of the moon is frozen. The moon's mind does not tell the moon's fingers the keys so the moon's soul can understand.This mind tells the arm Pepsi so the mouth drinks. This mind tells the fingers the keys to touch so the words come and the soul understands. This hand tells others store, chicken so the mouth eats and the belly does not hurt.Sometimes the others obey. Sometimes they do not. And the body hurts.The mind of the moon plays with the clouds. Arranges the stars.Sometimes the sky obeys. Sometimes it does not. And the moon hurts.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
