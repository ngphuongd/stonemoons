A spot of dust chooses sometimes to notice another spot. They whirl around each other, tighter, tighter, staring out at each other through the corners of their being.When they are close enough, they form things. Glass. Wood. Tables. Arms.Sometimes when the light hits them, they blink and shatter.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
