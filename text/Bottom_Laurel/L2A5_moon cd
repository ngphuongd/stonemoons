The earth will not be the moon's cd. The earth has only little lights that make too many colors, too many spaces.The moon wants only one space. She wants a place to hide, to find her own.The hands pummel the chest so the flesh inside can let the moon in.The moon changes the color of the flesh, the colors of dark purple and old blood so she can match the clouds she clothes herself in.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
