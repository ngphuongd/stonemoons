 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  3/13/97BEGIN TIME:  19:09END TIME:  19:56FACILITATOR:  SarahOther moving beings are people beings. They need the comfort of rules, the gentle dictators of a watch. They keep the numbers. They understand the numbers.If others slip away from these numbers, then the whole fabric of their lives must be shredded.The mind knows their numbers. 3 + 13 + 97 = 113. 19 + 29 = 48This is why the arms of the others hold the arms and the legs too tight.This is why the arms do not let go.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
