And the night stayed so dark that even he could not see his way and had to rest in the night.This may or may not be so. At any rate, it was certain that the moon was missing for a very long time. And while the moon was gone, a cradleboard with a glowing child appeared at the feet of the oldest woman in the tribe. The oldest woman took it and nursed it, for as the child touched her breast, milk once again began to flow. The woman named her child She-Who-Comes-Quietly. And the child grew strong, going out each day and bringing back game and berries out of season. And her skin grew rosy in the daylight. At night, she glowed softly, like ground corn caught in light.Still the moon lay dark, and still the stars refused to shine. Coyote now was desperate* to play in the moon's light, as the harsh sun burned his nose and ruffled his ears. He started to prowl about the tribe, looking for light to throw into the sky. He poked his nose into one teepee, and the woman brought her mano down upon it, bruising it. Coyote howled off and poked his nose into the next teepee, searching for the fire he himself had given them.But the people were angry at Coyote for chasing the moon away, and would have nothing to do with him. Instead, they gathered in the oldest woman's teepee at night, gazing at She-Who-Comes-Quietly, soaking in her light.Finally, Coyote wondered what they were all up to, each night and every night, slipping away to the oldest woman's teepee. So he danced about the edges and got his nose under one of the stones on the west end. He saw the light from the girl and thought to himself:  "Aha! that is where the moon is hiding! I'll show them!" So he wriggled his way under the teepee and snatched the girl up, running out of the east hole. The people were catching up to him quickly, too quickly. So he flung her up into the sky, and said "Now, stay there this time!" But the girl came down from the sky and changed into a woman far older than the oldest woman. She said "Coyote, I am always here, always in the form you least expect. But I will stay in my sky now and not visit you here again. I will change often, too, just so that you may watch and learn." Then Changing Woman went back up to the sky, for she truly was the moon, as everyone knows.And only the oldest woman wept.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
