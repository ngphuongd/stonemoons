Note from the authors to the reader:You have travelled far through this work.  Perhaps you know everything you need to know—and perhaps you don't.What you have seen, what you have not seen, does not matter.If this were an academic tome, we could sit over coffee and chat about the hyperpoesis of automatic text decomposition, or the taxonomy of hypermedia as a change agent, or better yet, navigational bewilderments in hyperstructures.  But we have no point to prove or position to keep.  We have only a story to tell.  Or to keep from telling.  By now, you've poked through most of the major materials.  If you have found one point to shiver over, we'll rest content.So, if you want to keep lurking about, please feel free to stay as long as you like.  Otherwise, we will bid you a fond farewell.—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—Click anywhere on this page to explore.Return to the Major Players:  Sarah / The Moon /  LaurelOr leave us:On a Mac, choose DONE from the READER menuOn a Windows machine, choose EXIT from the FILE menu.
