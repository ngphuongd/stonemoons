A poor young rice farmer's daughter went wandering through a bamboo forest gathering young ferns. A rain had just fallen and the air and ground glistened in the newness of promised growth. She gathered more ferns and strayed much further than she ever had before. Before she knew it, she was completely lost. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, she stopped to rest and take her bearings. But when she woke, the waxing moon was nearly midway through the dark, starless sky."Oh hare*, oh hare, up there pounding your rice cakes," she cried to the moon, "Grant me swift feet and a clear head that I might run home quickly. My poor parents will soon die of fright for me if they have not already!"As she ran, the trees thickened about her. She fled faster through the forest, her fast footsteps barely making a sound in the moist fallen leaves. Her breath came quick and hard, a delicate intrusion in the thick of the night. Nothing else stirred.Finally, she reached the clearing where her father's paddies lay, gleaming softly with the shadows of the moon. She walked up to her father's house, but the door had slid shut and was fastened tight. She walked around to the firehole, and peered into the darkness.Her father and mother were inside safely sleeping, and her own form glittered harshly between them. The young girl screamed, and her father rushed out to see what was going on. The girl rushed up to him, threw her arms around him and cried "Father, father! can't you see me? Am I so changed? Who is visiting?"The father shooed her off, and made the sign of protection against witches. "Be off with you, fox-girl!" He cried. "Our daughter is safe at home with us in bed. Go torment someone else and leave us alone!"Knowing that the cold form in bed was not her own, but a changeling, a moon-child sent to satisfy her father and mother, the girl screamed louder.  But the father shut the door firmly and would not listen.  The girl ran back into the forest. She touched the pads of her feet, felt the sharp growth of her nose and the soft, pointed ears."Hare," she said, "I shall take every one of your rice cakes for my family. Then they will believe it is me!" And she jumped up to bite the moon. The moon grew smaller, and the hare pounded more and more furiously. As far as I know, the fox girl is still leaping, determined to get every last rice cake. But sometimes she must rest, and then the hare can catch up.Press on___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
