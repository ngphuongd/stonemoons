NOTE:Bureaucrazy, n.  The regulations that choke government agencies in catch 22s (You can't have y until you have z, you can't have z until you have y), expensive propositions (you have to meet this specification even though that situation won't come up for a million years), and delays (well, our next budget cycle is in 2 years, so come back in about 4 years for funding).##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
