After she would leave, we would straighten the house. We shooed the shouts and dark noises into the back corner of the closet. I would take the broom, because I was a little taller, and we would sweep the hurts into a dustpan and carry it outside, Kelly holding the edges tightly, carefully, so nothing could spill.And we would be ok. If she didn't come back  that night, I would get us up, dress us in something clean, and fix sandwiches out of anything edible in the refrigerator. I would tell Kelly not to say anything, because someone from Social Services was always listening to little kids, ready to pounce on them and take them off to reform school or something if they thought anything at all was wrong. Kelly would nod solemnly. We both knew that Social Service people only looked human. Really they were vultures, which you could always tell by the fleshy folds at the front of their throat, the last vestiges of scavengry that they could never quite hide. Somehow, looking back, I guess what was funny was that Kelly and I believed implicitly in the horror of the Social Services, yet discredited completely notions of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.Once, when she had been gone for three days, I pasted up a poster I stole from the home ec room of a woman with a short-sleeved frock dress—the fifties kind with the stuffed skirt, cut off at the knees. This is our mommy now. I told Kelly. No it isn't, she said. She doesn't have any legs. How can it be a mommy if it can't walk out?___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
