It is about dusk, and I can see the horizon at the end of the long, silent alley.  The harvest moon rises, slow and gravid like a blood orange. I watch the moon, and as the light travels through the alley,  it touches me.  I see the blood that has run down my legs and congealed in dark, shiny strips.  I look completely dispassionately at my ripped open belly.  Beside me is a baby, but the cord is dried, brittle with age.  I turn the baby over, and it is Laurel, the first time I saw her. Only I am not holding her. I am not touching her.  Her legs, like mine, are splayed.   Blood flows freely from her torn mons.  Too much blood from a child.  A sudden torrent of desperation* fills me.  I try to touch her.  To breathe all of my blood back into her.  Anything to have her live, to have her untouched.  Her broken body disappears in a sudden shaft of moonlight, leaving only a ghostly outline of pain. She has said nothing*.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
