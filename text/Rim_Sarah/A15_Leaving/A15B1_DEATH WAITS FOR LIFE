To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Truth filesLaurel's atoms, embued with the moon's knowing, proved too large for those of us condemned to breathe only in this world.  The shadows of sanity lost themselves in her senses, drowning in the luminescence that shone from Laurel's pores.And we, living among only the husks of shadows, could not see her light.Thus we wrapped her as we would have wrapped the moon's words, if only we had known.  First in clothes of yellow and green, then in words ("autistic," "Rhett's,""retarded," " unacceptable"), then drapes of drugs (Clonidine, Risperdal, Naltrexone, Clomipramine, Prozac, Thorazine), finally sterner stuff of leather restraints and bricks.The moon knew this.  Waited.  Came down for her.And I watched her go.  Again.##go elsewhere___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
