So I went down there the Monday before last and said, ok, let's actually examine one, just one of these incidents. Luckily, her teachers are the kindest, sweetest beings with hearts of 38 karat (64 karat? 128 karat?) gold. And Marilyn and Carrie let me watch the whole day from the one way mirror.Nothing of course happened. Wouldn't you know kids would turn out just like cars or computers—when you want something to go wrong so you can diagnose it, obviously it won't. Murphy's 3rd or 4th law, I forget my inlaws, let alone my physics.That twilight, Laurel was out playing and a dog came up to her. She doesn't like strange dogs, and started to sway back and forth (her little channel surfer, Carrie likes to call it). The dog bit her on the nose despite her feeble protection. She came running in, took her shoes off, and snuggled a toy cat up to her nose. The next day, Carrie called to tell me she was being impossible, screaming at some puppets. I came down. The class was doing a puppet show on dogs. Laurel was crouched in the corner, her back arched over her shoulders higher than any cat, her fingers out like cruel claws, hissing madly to herself. Just shows to go ya.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
