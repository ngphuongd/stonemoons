Dr. Alfred, the behavoir specialist, provided  two bean bag chairs and a blanket, and Laurel sits in one and they cover her with the other and lie on it, forming a Laurel sandwich.  They are teaching her to request this by moving her hands together over a pencil. Marilyn often massages her hands while she leans on the top bean bag. They always stop when she "tells" them to.This corresponds to occupational therapy or sensory integration.  It seems to soothe her and they don't have any violent episodes after the sandwich treatment.Most mothers talk about which brand of peanut butter smooths on better. I talk about Temple Grandin's squeeze machine that does the same thing but would cost about $800 if you make it yourself or $4000. Or intelliTools' catalogue of keyboards and software and adaptive stuff for customized communication boards. Which is why I don't star in all that many commercials.Then we get into southpaw occupational therapy, wieghted belts, shoes, blankets, swings, etc....I'm thinking of starting a list.You know you are a special parent when:  § Your kids don't have toys—they have therapy equipment§ You think koosh balls build fine motor skills§ Your kid falls off the roof and all you can say is "We need to emphasize upper body gross motor skills for a while"§ You don't have a living room and a family room—you have a gross motor area and fine motor area. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
