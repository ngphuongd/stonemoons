NOTE:Hecatomb.n. Sacrifice of one hundred victims to Hecate. This happened quite frequently, and always on the dark of the moon.I'm not sure if this is what Hecate wanted in the first place, or if she grew to want it later.  The taste of blood grows on you after a while.     ##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
