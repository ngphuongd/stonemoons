I had already decided to try this, and I have been getting the insurance and information release paperwork in to a psychiatrist I'm not entirely comfortable with, but who will probably be adequate in his limited role. He knows pharmaceutical interventions, and he's conservative.He knows nothing about other forms of intervention. Even so, the first med may not be the right one, and it could take three weeks or more to even know what effect the first thing we try will have. So that's a yes, but not fast enough, and the results are not guaranteed.So, looks like we'll be having enzyme and protease cocktail soup for lunch for a while. Anyone care to join us?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
