GOOD NEWS! Yes, sending Laurel home after she hits three times simply means that Laurel will hit three times and expect to go home.  So they decided to keep her in school when she is agressive.  Safety is still the number one concern, so how do we ensure that the teachers are safe?  Carrie objected to wearing protective gear (my idea) for reasons I don't understand. She said it was like sending teachers to karate class to learn to defend themselves. My thought was, "What's wrong with that?" Do what you need to do to help the child. In fact, the district ought to sponsor karate classes where teachers could learn how to subdue kids without hurting them. Now, the teachers are forced to rely on their instincts, which probably do more harm than good in most cases. I tried to explain this, but the staff was so aghast at the idea that they turned their ears inside out. And would not listen.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
