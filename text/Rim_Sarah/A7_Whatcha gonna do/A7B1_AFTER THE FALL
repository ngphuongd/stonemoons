The choice is between the shadows of words and the things themselves. And the moon's blood was so powerful that the things became words alone and left only the dead shadow husks of themselves behind.The people saw that they had lost something precious, but could not remember what it was. So they sacrificed to the moon, once and then one hundred fold. Still, the moon could not return the lost substances. And the moon wept.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
