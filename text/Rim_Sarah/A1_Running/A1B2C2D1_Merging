To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Heart filesI knew I could do this. I began to know the strength of my cells when my child first formed and my cells took everything to nourish her cells. When my blood spilled out from the birth pains, when my body heaved and every muscle, every tendon bore down to force my child into the light, I knew. From then on, my body would do anything to protect my child. My cells would take power from beyond themselves, gather it, and save it for when my child cried out.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
