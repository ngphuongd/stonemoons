I approached an altar, and I saw a book*, worked in silver thread, written in the moon's own blood. I knew it then. This is the stone treasure the dragon kept watch over, waiting lest anyone approach. This is what all men search for, though they call it different names:  the grail, the golden apples, the ark of the covenant, which disappeared in the destruction of the temple. This is what Laurel needed, the thoughts she was so frightened of, at the end.With this gift, I understand. <~~Go back  Press on~~>___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
