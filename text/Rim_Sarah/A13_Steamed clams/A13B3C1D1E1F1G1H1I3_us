Somehow Laurel is standing by my hospital bed. Her eyes open, staring at the orange lines across the blue-black monitor above me. She sways back and forth in time with the line, like a ball bouncing on the floor, smaller and smaller arcs coming to rest.We do not speak.This time, I do not know if she is awake or dreaming. It slowly occurs to me that we may have switched souls. I will go to the moon for you, little one. I may have said this.Neither of us understand.##go back##press on___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
