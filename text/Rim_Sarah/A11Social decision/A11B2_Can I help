I finally scraped together a loan from a friend when we started to eat flour and water pancakes spiced with oregano.  The cupboards offered nothing else.So Laurel and I ventured out to Safeway.  The trip in the car was fine.  No worries.   We managed to get a TON of groceries, Laurel held my hand and protested only once, when I passed up the Pepsi.  She put it in and we went on.  I thought it a small price to pay for peace.It was only as we were heading for the car that Laurel started in.  I'm not sure what sin I committed.  It was heinous, though, and Laurel was protesting for all she was worth.  We got about 20 feet out of the main Safeway entrance—where everyone who was anyone seemed to be that day.  Laurel wrenched herself out of my carefully-tutored hold and threw herself in a writhing, shrieking mass on the ground.  My attempts to regain a hold cost me some hair and a chip off one tooth.  I simply could not get her up.  I determined that my best option would be to back off, signal the traffic to drive around her, and wait until she calmed down.Everyone stared.  That's not a trite statement; I mean at a rate of twenty drivers and maybe sixty pedestrians a minute, every single person bar none stared.  They whispered.  They pointed.  My eyes burned.  My stomach churned.  My brain felt like it would split with all the things I wanted to say.And then I heard the voice.  "Can I help?" it said.  The woman stood not two feet away.  I have a vague impression of a slight, blond creature, her hair making a halo around a face I couldn't see through a haze of unfallen tears.  I imagined the damage my precious tazmanian devil would do to this small naive creature.  I couldn't risk the lawsuit.  But somehow my voice found the courage to ask, "Could you please just stand here with me?  So I don't have to be alone?"We stood there, on the asphalt.  And I let out all those things I'd been aching to say to the staring faces:  "She's big for her age, and she's autistic.  She's not a brat.  She's frightened and she can't explain why.  The world doesn't make sense to her.  She just needs to feel safe. . . ."  And slowly, an amazing thing began to happen.  The staring faces stopped looking judgmental and condemning and cold.  Each and every one of them was thinking that they wanted to help — they just didn't know how.  They were afraid they'd embarrass me, or get in the way.  This angel had the grace to speak for the good heart in all humanity, and to let me hear them.After eight and a half minutes — it sounds like no time at all, but believe me, it's forever when your kid is lying in the middle of a busy intersection — Laurel calmed down and I walked her to the car.  The angel went into the store.She only said those three words.  And I wouldn't recognize her face if I saw her again.  I'd rather hear "Can I help?" than "I love you" any day.  Those are the three most beautiful words in the world.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
