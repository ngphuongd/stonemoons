How?There are so many choices offered, so many types of hope.   Every few months, the Autism Society of America's Colorado Chapter Quarterly comes out, with everything from calls for research participants for neuropsychological studies to causes (is it genetic?  allergens? early antibiotics? reactions to vaccines?) to cures (drugs*,  diets*, occupational therapy).  Take this drug, do this aversive, try this behavior mod.  The Loovatz method boasts an 80 percent rate  of cure—the Loovatz method is debunked.  A newspaper article shows a child "reunited" with his family on the xyz method—the next paper shows a child was killed at the xyz clinic and the method is shown to be ineffective.What to do and when to do it is my main concern for Laurel.  Have I completely blown her chances for communication, for an independant life because I did not go to New Orleans for the abc method?  Or in not going, did I save her life? This is more than a 64,000 dollar question. This is her life.  But then of course, insurancefatekarmamoon keeps conspiring against me on this one.Let me just take one example.  Auditory Integration Therapy, has a couple of offshoots, but the main idea is to strengthen the hairs in the inner ear and recharges the "channel to the brain and nervous system."   It is thought that autistic children have hypersenstive hearing—a refrigerator sounds to them like standing next to an airplane ready for takeoff would sound to us.  (Thought, hell.  PROVEN.  Laurel makes such a fuss when the air conditioning goes on in the next room that we use her reaction to determine whether or not the air conditioner is actually working.)  So the first question is, which branch?  The Tomatis method takes 75-120 hours of listening and the Berard takes 10.  Each claims success, each claims different methods, each claims different theories behind the success.  The second question is, where will the money come from?  It's $100 an hour, no matter which method you take.  This is of course, experimental, so my insurance won't pay for it.  (Mind you, I pay about $300 a month for this insurance, as I am not currently employed with a legitimate employer to kick in any insurance benefits.)   Then we fight that battle.  Well, insurance will pay for it if a  psychiatrists on the preferred provider list refer  Laurel to the program.  So I spend three days going down the insurance provider list.  This one is not doing any referring, this one is out of town, this one is retiring.  I finally find a psychiatrist that does referrals, but he won't work with autism.  So then I get the school to try to buy into it, but they need the scientific data, which the Auditory Integration Therapy centers aren't giving out.  So I get around that, we get it into the Individualized Education Plan somehow, and then both centers close in Denver and the nearest one is in Montreal.  Which the district will not stand for.So,what to do really does become the question.  I follow up one tantalizing lead (step right up ladies and gentleman, see the dead brought back to life! See the preverbal*, aggressive child take biology and calculus in high school!  Witness a miracle!)  only to work through the dead ends and find the choice withering away.  Should I have spent that time and money chasing down a different pipe dream?  Or would I be better off to do nothing at all?This is what I do not know.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
