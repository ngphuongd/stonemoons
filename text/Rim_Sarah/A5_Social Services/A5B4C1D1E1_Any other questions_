The other day, Dr. Joseph Elnor (the tenth or twelfth in a long line of people called in by social services) examined Laurel.  There were bruises on Laurel's arms and back, and Social Services thought it was probably Mom who caused them.  I told them that I most certainly had not bruised my daughter, but they were welcome to examine her.  Which they did.The guy was actually pretty sympathetic, joking about how we'd come a long way from the 50's diagnoses of cold mothers. He didn't subscribe to Bruno Betleheim's theories, he said, although they were still taught in the med schools as best practice.  "But we all know better now," he said. And patted my knee.It only took about three interns to hold Laurel down while he looked at her.   The interns wore gloves, and you could see the latex marks like a blue delft china pattern on her pale skin when they finished.When Dr. Elnor took his gloves off from the inside out and washed his hands thoroughly in the metal sink, he turned his face to the wall and said I needed to do a much better job of supervision. Laurel's bruises were pretty much self-explanatory, (in fact, he couldn't tell what were original bruises and what were added from the examination) but these little accidents were simply too much. Obviously, letting a kid in a cast climb back up on the roof was bordering on negligence and quite possibly abuse. But given the circumstances, he really didn't think it would be a good idea to report my case to Social Services as neglect. Was there anything he could do to help?I asked "Do you know a good babysitter?"He walked out.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
