And how they actually took the ideas Chris and I had been using and implemented them in the classroom?I've been thinking about that meeting a lot lately. And it just recently dawned on me what I should have said. (Yeah, I know, most people think of comebacks five minutes after the meeting. Me, it takes a few months. But they are good when I get them.)Ms. Scratcherd, the new school psychologist, (whom they are sharing with six other elementary schools, so she goes, well if this is Tuesday, it must be Cattail Elementary.) Her suits are extremely professional, down to the little lace at the throat that apparently Working Woman still insists is the key to success. Anyway, at one point she turns to me and says, "Well MOM, what do you think?"Now I know. I should have just said, "Gee, I don't know, SHRINK, what do you think?" But at the time, it didn't occur to me. Too simple, I guess. I just spouted off with the latest theory about opiod excess and gluten sensitivity that I got off the Internet last night. Which got me a big fat nowhere."Well, MOM, that idea has never been scientifically validated," she said and left muttering about something. Professional secret societies probably. I forget what.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
