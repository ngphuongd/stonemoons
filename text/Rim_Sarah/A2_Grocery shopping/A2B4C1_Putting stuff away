Things are calm now. Laurel is spinning plates in the kitchen, just where I can see her.  She looks up at the ceiling and grins about ever three minutes, and her shoulders shrug back into a laugh.  Reliving the moment, no doubt.Janet went to bed after the ninty-nth showing of Beauty and the Beast. She wants to be just like Beauty when she grows up, and she keeps putting her hair in that thick-sided ponytail.  Her primary goal in life? Not to read and get ahead. Oh no. To sprinkle bird seed and have birds come down on her head. She is all for practicing right now, but I told her Mrs. Pots had already put Chips to bed. And she believed me. For once. Right, back to the tale at hand. I have mixed feelings about confessing that, upon our arrival at home, I took Laurel into her room and spanked her. Laurel locked her door herself and stayed in self-imposed exile for about 6 hours.I put away groceries. I called the Dr Morgan, our latest pediatric neurologist, who has had extensive experience with autistic kids.  Or at least as much as anyone.  And at least he understands that each kid is different.  Got the Ellie, the new nurse practitioner. She suggests giving Laurel a higher dose of the Clonidine* prescribed (at an already ridiculously high dose) last spring. We agree that Laurel is in distress and needs help. They have an opening for an emergency appointment next week, and will call if something comes up sooner*.    Laurel went to sleep on the kitchen floor, and I just put her soft blanket near her so she can cover up if she wants to.  She is sleeping the slep of the dead, the truly exhausted.  As I will be in a few minutes.  First, I want to wash off my arms and take a long bath—the first I have had time for in a long time. I have about 3 dozen bleeding scratches and bruises that won't show fully for days. My arms looked like violent rejects from an octopus-lover. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
