Any how is it, life has certainly calmed down in the last month or so. Dad took care of Laurel while I went to work for a couple of hours (a stop-gap, temporary driving job for a friend...) The comm book is working. We add about four new words a day—Laurel peruses the paper's ads like a pro. We have a watch picture that she sets to match the hall clock (and I thank god every day it is the old fashioned hands and seconds, the numbers would be just too fast to change). The sun gods have smiled down upon us—we have gone for walks on the Highline Canal every day for the past week and have crossed Colorado Boulevard without a single incident. Janet has a new toy—someone showed her how to use an old vaccuum tube to suck crayfish out of the creek without getting any of the water on her or in her. So she sucks them out, touches the claws, says ooooh, tries to get Laurel interested, and then carefully puts them right back in the water.Laurel has gone to Safeway every day this week to buy Pepsi and Doritos. She does not eat them—or rather, she tears open the plastic, places three Doritos in her mouth, hums "Peanut, peanut butter" with more enthusiasm than the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and chomps down hard. Then she leaves the package on top of the refrigerator.And who is to thank for this wondrous interlude? Dr. Morgan credits the Risperdal*  he prescribed to replace the Clonidine, Ms. Bradshaw thinks it is the good weather, Mrs. Macdougal thinks Social Services has finally gotten to my case, and me, I'm afraid the fragile structure of this peace would collapse under scrutiny. I point blank refuse to analyze.  Under no threat of anything.Laurel is going through a bed smoothing phase right now. She takes the sheet and smooths it over her bed, gently rubbing out every single wrinkle. When she gets finished, she does it again. She is occupied in this for hours at a stretch. I even bought bath salts the last time we were out. And used them. Morning Mist. And had time to notice something. I am not even bruised anywhere right now. For the first time in ages of months. (Ages of monks? How old are monks, anyway?)Even better—Laurel is not cowering over the cherry bombs and stink crackers resounding in the street. She is simply avoiding the windows. Hoorah, an action to control her environment, as the shrinkspeak says. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
