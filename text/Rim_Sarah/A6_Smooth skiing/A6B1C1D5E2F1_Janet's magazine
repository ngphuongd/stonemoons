I read everything the library had on autism.  Then I subscribed to the Autism Society newsletters, and the Autism Research Review.  Janet  would ask what I was doing, and I'd tell her about the fascinating book or article I was reading.One summer day, Janet came up to me as I sat reading on the steps.  She pulled something invisible out of the imaginary pocket of her diaper and commanded, "Read this!""What is it?" I asked."A magazine," was her calm reply."What's it about?""ME!"I got the message.  ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
