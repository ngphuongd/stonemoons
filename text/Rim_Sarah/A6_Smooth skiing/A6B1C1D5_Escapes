Janet is great about disappearing from view* when her presence is just another threat on the horizon.  Her uncanny sixth sense lets her appear just in time to take over some of the necessary functions of life (like paying the cashier for our groceries or answering the door and keeping our sanctity safe from random Jehovah's witnesses, newspaper collections, and Amway distributors).Still, I can't help thinking she'd be better off elsewhere, especially right now. It can't be good for any child to see her mother holding down her sister (no matter what the provocation, and believe me, I have much more provocation than most).  It is also probably pretty frightening to see me with blood running down my neck and shoulders or missing chunks of hair.  (At any rate, if I saw someone looking like me, I'd be terrified).  To put the final cap on it, I can't give Janet the attention* she needs.   I think she understands this better* now that she is older, but I feel horribly guilty when I can't spare the time for her.  Who can she be* if she grows up like this?I called my sister,  Kelly,  last night and asked if she and her husband and her 8-year-old daughter would take Janet for a while. She said they'll talk it over and get back to me. But now they live in Riverside, CA, which is gang-ridden and smoggy, and 1,200 miles from here. I'm not sure what I feel. I think she would be happier. I'm not sure I would be.This may be the temporary answer we all need. But somehow, I can't see sending my kids away. Not either of them.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
