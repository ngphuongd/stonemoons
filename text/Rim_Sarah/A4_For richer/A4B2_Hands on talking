This has been an incredible summer, but once more, Houston, we have contact!  We have lift off!  Lemme explain.  Last night, I went to a Facilitated Communication Workshop put on by the Colorado Chapter of the Autism Society of America.  When I got home, I told Laurel I'd found a great way for us to communicate.  I would learn to help her and we'd be able to talk to each other.  She could ask me questions and tell me what she wanted.She immediately began to make more direct eye contact, smile, and respond to my voice.  She hummed loudly and began to rock with my hand.  I got her desk and chair and put a photocopy of an  IntelliType keyboard in front of her.  I said, "Come here and sit down."  And she came right over and sat by me, her hand searching for mine again.  I asked her to find "A," holding my right hand over hers to isolate her index finger.  Laurel pushed the power button several times, but I told her it was just a paper copy and if this worked we would get a real one.  I said again, "Find A."  Her finger hovered gently over the left of the center row (where A would be on a computer keyboard).  Janet was hovering too, wanting to get in on this new type of game.  "You're so slow Laurel," she said and grabbed Laurel's hand, dragging it over to the "A."After a short break, I asked Laurel to spell her name.  She pushed "L."   I praised her and put an orange starburst on the keyboard by L.   She typed "LA" "LA" "LA" and vocalized "LO, LO, LO" (which when you say the first sylable of her name makes a certain amount of sense.  I wonder what she makes of phonics!). Then, wonder of wonders, she smiled and looked at me.  I said, "Okay, now 'U.'"  and she pressed "UR" and said, "LOR."  After about a minute, she pressed "LLLLLLLLLLL"  and sang, quite clearly, "Peanut, peanut butter."  She pushed back the desk and ran over to the refrigerator.  She said, "wa, wah," and then said "peh, peh."  I got out the Pepsi, but she really wanted a grape popsicle.She flopped on the couch as if exhausted, and Janet went to croon over her.  But Laurel kept returning to the desk and her paper.  She pressed "L" and several other letters. I facilitated.  She left after a few minutes and I did not pursue it.  Before bed that evening, Laurel had said more than she had said all summer:  "dog," "I want," "shower," and even "good." (she had never before attempted "good"Ñneedless to say,  I was thrilled).  She made unusually direct and frequent eye contact and appeared happy and excited.  She even "ahhhed" along when Janet sang "Somewhere Out There" at bedtime.A good night was had by all.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
