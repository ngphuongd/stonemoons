Dimly, the shadows sensed that they were not what they had once been, and the shadows wrote their own words of a golden age which none of them could remember.The moon read their words and wept.  Seeing the shadows' longing, the moon tried to make things right. She erased part of a scroll, the one that talked of the ways people understood the universe, conversed with the stars, and kept faith with themselves and the animals. But as she erased the words, these things were not strong enough to reappear in the world, and so they fell out of existence altogether.The moon tried to breathe life into the words. But the words had lost the ability to breathe with her. They stared, lifeless, on the page.And the moon could not reach them in their tombs*.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
