He had me giving her enemas twice a week, until she turned up anemic.  Nothing worked.  At his insistence, we went to a psychiatrist, Dr.  Graybill, a sweet lady who each session first drank a full diet Doctor Pepper and then smoked four Virginia Slims, using the empty can as an ashtray.  Laurel was fascinated by the way the ash settled into the rim of the can and would tip the can slightly to see how far the ash would move.  At first, I tried to prevent this, but Dr. Graybill smiled and explained that she wanted to see how Laurel reacted on her own.  I smiled back and relaxed—as much as we could.  Laurel started with her frightened moaning but gradually relaxed into her scaled screaming.  I rocked Janet and talked over the screams, telling her how lonely I'd been, how difficult it was to see anyone, how no one would stay to help and how I could not find the resources I needed to survive.She asked me how I was making it, and I said, one second at a time.  She asked why I hadn't sought help, and I showed her the file.  She asked why I hadn't simply let Laurel go into an institution where they could help and I told her Laurel needed me, that I hadn't seen an institution that could help.  She asked me if I had looked very hard*.  We went for four sessions, each a month apart.  At each session, I showed her the results of my searches, the societies, the doctors I had called, the bills I had not been able to pay.  I told her I could not pay her bill, either, that we would have to work something out.  On the fourth session, Dr. Graybill said she had the answers.  All Laurel and I needed was a break from each other, she said. A short vacation for both of us would do wonders*.  I could sleep, catch up on my humanity.  Laurel, freed from my grasp, could become normal.And she had found the very place.  Oak Ridge Institute would take Laurel on a trial basis, just so we could have the breathing space we needed.  I was too tired to do anything but agree.##Higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
