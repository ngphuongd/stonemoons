To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Psych filesDateLine:  Spring 1990I put Laurel in the Oak Ridge Institute on a "trial basis."  Dr. Graybill got around the waiting list by saying it was an emergency, temporary placement.  We would find the way to pay the bills somehow.  Dad said it was the best thing for all of us and presented me with a prepaid hotel stay * at the Red Mountain Inn in Glenwood Springs.Janet and I stayed  for six glorious days.  I called the Oak Ridge Institute twice a day, asking about Laurel. They said she was fine, that she was doing well, and had stopped screaming about thirteen hours after I left.  They said she was eating. They said she was not making eye contact, but that would come in time.I took some of the time for myself.  I had a shower that was over an hour long, treated myself to a hot oil treatment, an actual hair cut, and long sessions in the two olympic size pools of natural hot springs.  As I lay in the hot water and looked up at the newly green mountains, I wondered if I should have done this a long time ago.  After all, I told myself, the experts did in thirteen hours what you failed to do in thirteen months.  Maybe I really am a bad influence on my daughter.  Maybe I did cause this.I looked over each of my actions with a magnifying glass for the seed crystal, the action I could hold up and say, this was the catalyst. This was the cause of the whole thing.  Had she heard our whispered fights?  Had I tried to toilet train her too soon? Given up too soon? Was it being pregnant with Janet? Had I rubbed my belly where she could see me? Breast fed her too long?  Not long enough?  Fed her the wrong breakfast cereal?  My mind raced faster than the wind in the pine trees.   The bubbles streaming up from the chair as I lay there did nothing to calm my nerves.##Higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
