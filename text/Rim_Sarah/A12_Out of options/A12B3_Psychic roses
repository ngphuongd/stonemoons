I'll take help wherever I can get it, without religious or other discrimination.On April 2, Jackie wrote:> Sarah, how can you endure this and mostly alone dealing with>all the conflict and the issues of Laurel at home, Janet at home and you>muddling along trying to be all things to all people?Darling woman-friend, I have never lost a child, as some on this list have. I do not have to know that my child lives in constant pain, or will not live to grow up, as some people do. And if these blessings were not enough to celebrate, I've got me. I have learned over the screaming years to be resourceful and silly, tough and ...I don't have a word for it. Solid, I guess. Frankly, I admire me. I think I would fall apart completely if I were a whiner or one of those martyr types who thinks she must be a bad parent to have children with problems. I don't imagine myself the center of the universe to the extent that I think I am the genesis of my children's realities. Ick! And then, I have you. Literally dozens of Listmates who send me lovenotes and virtual chocolates. And for those who don't like me, I have a little box on the right-bottom of my screen that says DELETE*. Ah, if life were this easy...(actually, I am pretty much without detractors on this List. You really have to work hard to offend some people. I tell my sister she's a lousy mother and she's done everything wrong, and she posts a note telling everybody how wise I am. Sheesh!)On April 3, Bob wrote:> You must want to run away.

I'm not trusting enough for that. I could run away. Remembering that, and knowing that I am here because I choose to be, gives me strength. And if I feel that I want to lock her in her room, I do. I suppose that's where I'm better off than many moms of "average" kids; if I turn into Monster Mom, I can always say I ain't givin' anywhere near as bad as I'm gettin'.On April 4, Steve wrote> I have no gentle criticism.

I am thinking rose-scents and orange pulp bursting in my mouth and the melting smoothness of chocolates, and the passionate embrace of your love. I'm all misty, too.##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
