She could say that Laurel is a direct threat to herself and others, and lock her up for good. It would be interesting, though, to see her reaction. I don't think that she has any idea how bad this actually is. After all, I would be one of those who heals fast. Bruises barely last a week on me.  And I haven't actually gone out of my way to explain HOW violent Laurel is right now. This type of video would be great for blackmailing me, though. (If you demand much more, we'll show this to prospective teachers. The smart ones will turn tail and run...) I think video tapes of rages would be good for the pshrink, and videotapes of Laurel on her good days would be great for Bradshaw, Scratcherd, Maddox and co. If you see her doing math or typing on the computer, or stretching out with the gymnastics coach, she really looks like the sweet darling little girl you want in Brownies. Video cameras rent for $60 per day at Waxman. =:  o##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
