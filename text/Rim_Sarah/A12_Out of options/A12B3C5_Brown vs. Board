It's about an hour minute drive each way. The school has an indoor pool and a nice playground and well-appointed therapy rooms. But they have only Apple IIe's, and "a functional curriculum." The idea of academics for the elementary kids is gluing pinto beans to photocopied "A"s. My buddy Chris peeked in after I'd left the classroom and said the aides were doing the craft projects anyway; none of the kids seemed to be doing anything. No work was displayed on the walls above the kindergarden level (which is the oldest class that is integrated with "mainstreamable" kids). She said that they did lots of community stuff:  some of the high school kids, up to age 21, were doing things like going to a store and buying one item, or going to the mall and phoning the school (with constant supervision and direction).The psychologist and the social worker and teacher said that Laurel's "behavioral issues" would surely not be a problem for them, but that she would be the highest functioning student they'd ever had, and they really didn't feel that she belonged there. On the other hand, they had no idea of any program anywhere in the state (or even in the country!) that would be appropriate for her. ##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
