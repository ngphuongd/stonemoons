So this is a response to all.My friend Mona, who's child, Brian, is autistic and preverbal, called me from Minnesota for a catharsis session. I feel much better now. I cried and sobbed and she assured me that I was reacting quite sanely to the insanity of my situation. We laughed at morose jokes. When I got the hiccups from laughing too much, she suggested I put a bag over my head (and then hastened to re-phrase that.) It was hysterical and comforting.The funniest part, to me, was when I was telling her I've written a note to the consumer's advocate/troubleshooter on the local news but I don't have a stamp. Why would that cause me to burst into tears? I was sobbing my heart out and laughing at myself at the same time. (Yes, we we've been to the store a couple of times, but by the time we get to the check-out, I'm not capable of asking for stamps anymore. As Mona says, "I just can't think of any reason why THAT would be." This starts us both giggling and roaring and then I say "Nope, neither can I. Can't think of a thing." And we are off and running again.)We discussed, in rational voices, the relative pros and cons of simply getting Janet in the car and disappearing. (They'd _have_ to find someplace for Laurel then, right?) I told her that a father put his severly disabled son in the car up in Boulder a year and a half ago, drove up in the mountains and drove off a cliff. Jennie admired the ability to plan that far in advance. She has a point.You know, the perspective of sane people is counter-productive to people in insane situations. Only another resident of Planet "Special" can offer any useful advice at all.I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. Really. It's dropped my armor. Some of you really have sick senses of humor, which are totally appropriate.  When one is thinking in unhealthy terms, joking about unhealthy things is the only way to regain balance, if you know what I mean.  I am so glad no one has thought of tapping my phone!  That sounds weird. You know who you are.##higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
