I know why the moon has taken Laurel.  She, too, succumbed to the stronger forces of my daughter's alien beauty.Who can resist the translucency of water and glass and glass and water in endless rotation until it shatters into a million, billion stars.Anyone can see that the temptation is too great to resist. One perfect melody played on a strand of light.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
