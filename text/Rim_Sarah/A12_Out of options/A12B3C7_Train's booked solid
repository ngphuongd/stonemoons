Thank you one and all for your good wishes. Here is what I gave myself today:  good news and bad news.The good news is we found a group (? a business? an inc.?) that trains and coordinates temporary respite care providers. They specialize in behavioral intervention, they do training in-home for parents; they use Mandt restraint techniques and do comprehensive behavior treatment, serving those with serious aggression or other behavior problems. They have apparently existed in Colorado for 5 years, and in Minnesota for 20. The director of this place also mentioned Indiana. (Aside:  it's peculiar that so many of these places that serve the autistic* or Developmentally Disabled population specify that they won't take anybody with severe behavioral problems. Like, why else would you need help?) The inc. is called Valerian, Inc. Anybody who's had any experience with working with this organization in any incarnation, please post me. The director of Valerian also said the inc. could teach some of the district people restraint techniques and advanced behavior management. He also says he can teach me. Hooray! Not that I don't do pretty well; but it would be nice to have a few special tricks up my sleeve, and to be telling the truth when I say that I have special training so I know what I'm doing. (For those concerned citizens who question my right to try not to bleed so much when we're in public.)The bad news is they are booked solid until May. That is May of 2001.##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
