They want to send her to New Jersey.   There would be a conference about what our goals were, and I could stay for a few days in the guest cottage.  But then there would be no place for me.  The requisite catch-22 is, of course,  if I  move out there then Laurel is no longer a client of this district and loses her placement. The contract is with the district—not with Laurel, not with me.  And visits are a recreational, family thing, so the school wouldn't pay for that.Mother, they say, is too much of a distracting influence. The child will be a lot calmer if Mom isn't around.I calmly pointed out, over the phone to Ms. Bradshaw that if the district actually believed this, then why did they refuse to put Laurel in school? Why did they insist that she be in my "distracting" company for 24 hours 7 days a week?"The district," Ms. Bradshaw informed me, "has no other alternatives." "Why was New Jersey the only choice?" I asked. "Well, it is the only place that has an opening available right now." Ms. Bradshaw sniffed."So, let me get this straight. You are telling me that you want to send my child to a school with the sole criterion being that there is an opening." My voice raised incredulously.*  "Are you telling me that there is not one person in the state of Colorado who can educate my child?""Well, given the circumstances.... " Ms. Bradshaw's voice trailed off.So help me I couldn't help myself. I hung up.  Again.   And this time I did not call her back.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
