There is Charlie from the Wynkoop you met while you took that Denver Free University Class, the Art of Barhopping.  Or Benny who talked poetry but took most of it straight out of the Tao of Pooh.  Tim, the guy you had a crush on all through junior high, took up singing raucous Irish songs in bars and fishing boats and cruises in Alaska.  And Bob, your high school dates back, actually made it big on a screenplay and hightailed it out to Hollywood. You told him to look up your mother.  Surprisingly enough, he still calls occasionally.Any of these guys would be thrilled to go with you on a picnic in the Lair of the Bear, or hike Beaver Brook Trail from start to finish*.  But no. You would rather call him.  You don't understand why.  You think it is his eyes, the dark green flash of them.  You think it it more likely the way his chest ripples in the sun as he studies in Cheeseman Park.  You think it is the way he talks around his anatomy books.  You don't think.He is busy, he says. Each and every time you call.  You think again of the way the sun played with his long gold hair, tied in a black band.  You think about his long delicate fingers brushing across your wrists.  Your body thinks for you.You are swamped too, you say. "Can't we just meet anyway?""OK" he finally says. "Thursday evenings*.  A standing date. That way, I can have my peace and the weekends to study."You agree.  The Almond Cafe, you say.  You know the service is slow, and it is not too far from your house. He knows this too, but he agrees anyway.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
