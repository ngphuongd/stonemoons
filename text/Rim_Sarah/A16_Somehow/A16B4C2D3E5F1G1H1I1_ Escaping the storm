This bandage has held on for an hour or so.  I hope it lasts longer than the last time.  I am so tired. I remember bandaging the last time, but not the time before that.  I think I remember peace, but it is so far away I have forgotten what silence sounds like.She lies there, staring at the night sky, her voice the only thing moving.I touch her.  She does not flinch.  Her voice does not change.   I hold her. Her voice grows louder.  I put her down, cover the window, cover the crib.  Her voice grows softer, but I can still hear the unending keening.He has left for a hotel.  He cannot take the noise.  I ask Kelly to come over just for a few minutes. An hour or so. I tell her I am desperate.When she comes, I put my burgundy lace underwear under my wool slacks.  And hurry to him.  I need to have his arms around me.  I need to know he will not leave me.  #Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
