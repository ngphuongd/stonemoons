He said the title character was modeled on me, but we haven't even talked for ten years. What I seem to be getting at is reconciling who we were with who we have become.  It's an issue for everybody, especially for women, because the changes of time are more critical to how we are perceived by ourselves and others. But having a child with special needs makes such a dramatic, profound, pervasive difference, and so quickly—not just standing naked before a mirror, thinking of what my breasts and belly and butt used to look like before the stretch marks, before spaghetti and frosted flakes became household staples and sushi and aerobics became selfish indulgences. But thinking about what's happened to my mind since I stopped watching French films and settled for "Beauty and the Beast" over and over and over.  What's happened to my voice since I stopped discussing Sartre in coffee houses and singing folk songs in stair wells and started demanding my daughter's right to a free appropriate public education across a white laminate table under bright, flourescent lights. What's happened to my conversation skills since I stopped the witty, flirtatious banter at crashed cast parties and learned to reduce my words to slow, clearly enunciated instructions, repeated and prompted until Laurel finally manages to understand "put... shoes... on."  Men used to write poems about my eyes, my voice, the way my nose crinkled when I laughed. Now, no one sees me, no one hears me sing. I am dusty and creaky with disuse*. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
