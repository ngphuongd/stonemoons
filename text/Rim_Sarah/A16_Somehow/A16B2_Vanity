She was a strong, sturdy mother who could lift 110 pounds in a pinch? That I would stay up all hours clipping pictures from grocery store ads to try to teach my daughter to point to "chicken" or "potato chips," but rarely took the time to wash my hair? Who is this person I have become? And who will play me in the movie? ;) I used to be Pia Zadora. I was planning to be Sigourney Weaver when I grew up. Now I'm Roseanne. On good days. Sometimes I'm Al Pacino.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
