NOTE:This is what your father has told you all your life.  You know what he means.  When you brought home all Bs and he said, yes, that is the best you can do.  When you made that first dinner by yourself and served him burnt casserole and salted strawberries,  he said, yes, that is the best you'll ever have to offer.So take what you can get.  Because you don't deserve even that.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
