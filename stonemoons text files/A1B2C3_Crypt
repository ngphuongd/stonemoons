NOTE:Our local BDSM (Bondage and Discipline, Sado-Masochism) store.  The people there are incredibly friendly, extremely knowledgeable about every possible type of safe restraint.  They are beginning to know me quite well, actually.  I keep recommending them to other moms, school districts, and friends, but no one can quite get up the courage to enter the shop. I will admit that the chain bikinis and nipple clamps in the window are a wee bit intimidating.   Nonetheless, if I can brave a roomful of administrators, educators, and psychologists for my child, I can brave anything.##back__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
