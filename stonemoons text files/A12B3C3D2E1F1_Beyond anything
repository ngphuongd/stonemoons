To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Stuff to worry aboutIs there really anything beyond anything? The wall has gripped me so tightly I cannot think. Late at night I like to imagine the other side of the moon, the other side of time when my body is no longer sprained or broken twice a day.Anyone else would think that that would be heaven. But I have delved deep into their minds, those phantasms on the other side of anything. I know they do not feel anything, even their corpuscles are wiped clean of my memories.Beyond anything I could not nuzzle my Laurel, feel her fine spun hair in my dreams. Beyond anything I would not know the pain of my love.##higher##lower
