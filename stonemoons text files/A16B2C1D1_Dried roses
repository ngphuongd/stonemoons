To:   mmarconi@netcom.com, grahambell@aol.com, grever@ibr8smtp...From:   Sarah Date:  8/12/96Subject:  The scoop on lifeAs the UPS guy rang the doorbell, Kodi ran through the house and flung what little clean laundry I had into the layer of chocolate frosting Laurel had just smeared all over the living room couch, Janet dropped a hammer on her toe and started to scream, and the radio blew a fuse ( a quite natural reaction from being left on in a full bathtub).  Thus, it was a very good thing that the package was from Bob Spanish, my old MTV beau.  The brown box was taped over and over again, so naturally I took out the carving knife and went at it.  When it exploded, the living room was covered in pine curls and dried rose leaves, all coated over with frangipini scent.  To say the least, it was like nothing the living room had ever seen before.  And with it was a simple note:This is what you are to me now.Mind you, I still have not seen this guy for ten years.  At the very least.  But I like the imagery.  I am dried roses smelling of frangipini.  I am a soft, clean wood scent.  I am what Janet, what Laurel, need me to be.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
