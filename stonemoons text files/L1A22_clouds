 IntelliType   FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. DATE:  11/10/96 BEGIN TIME:  20:39END TIME:  21:11FACILITATOR:  SarahClouds are simple. They never try to say anything at all. Sometimes they dress the moon up when she floats behind them.That is because the noise of her being is far too difficult for them to bear. And so they spin themselves out before her, letting her sink into the quiet darkness that spins the core of their being.When she has borrowed enough silence, enough of the blood of the clouds to sustain her, she rises above them.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
