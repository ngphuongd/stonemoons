NOTE:Sacred to Artemis. Its intoxicating properties bestow the gift of poetry and prophecy—but not always the wisdome needed to understand these gifts. Symbolizes immortality and used to seal lovers and crown victors. Causes forgetfulness. ##back ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
