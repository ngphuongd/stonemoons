To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Soul filesThe moon makes her demands known in a  dizzying kaleidoscope of blood.  As I turn to face her pattern, it scatters as though it had never existed.The moon turns her fragments faster, knowing I cannot piece them together.  And I let the shards of her memory run through my fingers and cut my soul into fragile glass ribbons.After a while  AhaAll I really wantAltered sacrificesBones knowBorgesCell memoryDeath fearDenialDoubledFall silentGlass endingsGlass harmonicaGynastrisiaHarmHystericsImbibeLeft angles to the moonLife fearLife sparksListenLoose soulsLullabyMoon blessingsMoon eyesMoon madnessMoon motherMoon mothsMoonsistersMy soul is captured so far in my pain that I cannot free herOiche DhuibhreOnce again, shut downs wash over me, leaving only to return.PrayerPrayers unanswered Pro Re NataRageRepetitionRitualsScath GaelachSole remedySticky soulsStones understandStubbed outThe air between us fades.  She is alone.The moon's priceThe most preciousTobacco shardsTriumphsWarning lightsWhat I don't know What the moon forgotWild moons___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
