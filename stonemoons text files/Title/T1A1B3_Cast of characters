Among the major shards are:  Hina, Luonnotar, Mardoll, the creatress of the world. First woman, moon goddess, she sculpted time and earth in many cultures.Mictecaciutal, Macha Alla, Kalika, destroyer of souls. Ruler of the dead. In many cultures, she who determines the sea tides controls life and death.Artemis, guardian of the waxing moon. Especially worshipped in Arcadia. Worshippers gather around under the sacred bough of her moon tree to dance ecstatically. Virgin goddess of maternal blessings and plenty. Lady of beasts. In Olympian mythology, subverted as sister of Apollo and daughter of Zeus. Mother is at times Demeter/Persephone or Leto.Selene/Luna, carrier of the full moon. A winged goddess who drives a pair of crescent-horned oxen through the night skies. Essential in ancient magics, nearly vanquished in the Olympian mythology, and barely traceable today.Hecate, sorceress of the waning and dark moons. Great ancient goddess, she outshone her daughter Circe. Haunts crossroads, carries a scourge and a torch. Hecate suppers are laid out on the night of a dark moon, and consist of dogs, honey, wine, and black ewe lambs.Isis, Io, ancient moon goddesses transcribed into Egyptian and Olympian mythology. Hera protects Io from Zeus' attentions, first with a giant guardian, Argos. When Hermes slays Argus, Hera sends a gadfly to torment Io into fleeing to Egypt, thus saving her.Changing Woman, important Navajo and Apache female deity. She changes between baby, girl, woman, and old woman. Mother of Killer-of-Enemies and Child-of-the-water. Also the Eternal One, the Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies.___________________Sarah / Moon / Laurel___________________
