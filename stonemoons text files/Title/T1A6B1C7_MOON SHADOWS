You could not walk, because every inch of land was covered with a breathing animal. Even the ants could not squeeze through the immense pile of life. You could not sail the sea as every drop was taken by a breathing animal. Even the plankton could not wander through the waves of life. And the world was painful. Creatures grew older, joints aching, muscles straining, lungs pounding with every breath. The people complained of lumbago, rheumatism, arthritis, and every other sort of disease. Their knees hurt, their eyes squinted, their minds grew rusty from the constant wear of pain. But there was no death, no release. So the people cried out to the moon, telling her of their pain, of their strong desire for elbow room, of every other complaint that came from a world of never-ending life. And the moon called down. "What do you want me to do about it? It seems to be your lack of control, your hatred that is doing this to you. Besides, as I recall, you helped yourselves out the last time." This then was her answer. And the people said, "Very well. We will do something about it then." For they had learned to hunt, to eat of other life. So now they worked for many days and nights. Some gathered sticks and honed both edges to cutting points. Others moved bodies and dug a huge pit, lining it with dry grasses and smaller sticks. Still others lined the outside of the pit, all except the west side, with sharp thorns. Then some of the people drove every creature and person they could find into the pit. They called down fire from their brothers the sun people, and burned everything in the pit. This made the mass of people and animals smaller. But the charred bones and seared flesh still breathed, moaning in agony at each draught of air. And the sea remained unchanged.So the people again cried out to the moon. "You created this mess. You started it. Now do something about it."And the moon was tired of hearing their complaints. So she drew in a breath to the bottom of her being and blew it out upon the sea. And this breath was the chilling cold of death. Sea creatures died, leaving their bodies to flood the land. Land creatures died, leaving their charred and scarred bodies behind. And the water cleansed the earth of all the bodies, taking them deep inside the earth herself."Now when things are too much to bear," the moon told the people who were left, "I will come. I will take care of you. So stop complaining."The people never spoke to the moon again.##elsewhere  ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
