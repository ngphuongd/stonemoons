NOTE:At the turn of the millenium, we understand everything.  We have seen the atom as a universe unto itself.  We have stood upon the moon, the dust ground beneath our boots.  We know her cycles, her thoughts, her very essence.    And that essence is stone.   We have held her stones in our hands.  We know now.The moon is stone and stone alone.  No longer can she be the night goddess to hold our hearts in terror. Saying that the moon once had a voice and lost it, once created the world and destroyed it, is simply mouthing a string of sounds without meaning.  This is the way of the world.And those who think they know better should consult their physicians immediately.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
