NOTE:In China and Japan, the hare embodies power and immortality. His cakes are made from elixirs of immortality—once you taste one in your dreams, you will never die.The hare offered himself to the Buddha; or the Buddha— in one of his incantations as a hare—offered himself to a starving god, Sakra; or a female hare offered herself to a starving peasant, who turned out to be the Buddha. In any case, the Buddha or the Sakra placed the hare carefully on the moon, where he/she has been ever since.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
