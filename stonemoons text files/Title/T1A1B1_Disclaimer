NOTE:A disclaimer from the authors:This hypertext novel is fictional—however, many incidents are drawn from those in the trenches.This hypertext is not a medical manual for treating autism, nor is it a clinical description of all autistic children.  Rather, it is the story of one mother and her daughter.  Neither is this hypertext a social or political treatise on the welfare system of the U.S. or Colorado governments.  The governmental branches dealing with education and social services are harshly portrayed here.  We  know that there are great, incredible people in these organizations who are truly working to help people with disabilities.  However, we feel the systems themselves are flawed and have not bothered to keep our personal sentiments* from influencing this work.  Other than a few humble suggestions (get rid of the bureaucrazy*, let parents keep custody of their children, get parents involved in treatment, and treat parents with respect), we do not know how to fix the system.If the incidents in this work enrage you, we suggest you contact the Autism Society of America.  Find out about your local chapters and volunteer.  Or volunteer in any myriad of ways to help people in need.Caution: This hypertext is not endorsed by the Autism Society of America or any other person, product, etc.  mentioned herein.##Back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
