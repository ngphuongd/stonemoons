Close the door and lean up against it with all the strength of the arms, and the others go away for a little while.But the others can still knock on the door, and the hands that stay with the others transform themselves into a hollow language just outside the wood. The body always hides from the sound, because the mind tells the fingers they are too afraid to understand what it is they want.And the other hands keep on knocking, tearing themselves into the thin skin of the door.  The noise from the mouth does not stop the knocking.<---   --->___________________Sarah / Moon / Laurel___________________
