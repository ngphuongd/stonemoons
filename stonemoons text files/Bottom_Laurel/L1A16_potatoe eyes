 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  10/3/96 BEGIN TIME:  19:22END TIME:  19:38FACILITATOR:  SarahThings eat other things. Turtles eat fish, dogs eat turtles, people swallow everything—but they put it in packages first. The mind thinks about the eating, about the terror of sliding down the back of the mouth into an unknown wasteland, of never coming out alive again.Of all the eaters, though, the potato eaters are the worst. They eat the eyes of the potato first, leaving the pale white insides blind. There is no mouth in blind insides, otherwise the mouths of the potatoes would scream in terror at the potato eaters.So scream for them.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
