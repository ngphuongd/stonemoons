They never move and always hold what you want them to hold.Rocks understand what it is to be rocks. They hold themselves together and let the sun wash them warm.Mountains understand what it is to be mountains. They catch the sun and moon and let them go.But the others do not understand what it is to be the others. They call themselves the human people. They move too much.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon / Laurel___________________
