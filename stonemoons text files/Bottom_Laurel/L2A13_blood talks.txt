The scissors cut the skin so the blood talks to the air outside. The mouth tastes the Doritos salt of the blood. The nails scratch the flesh into rhythms interwoven with the harmony of the hums of the refrigerator.The blood flows freely.The voice of the blood understands the slow patterns the sun makes. The voice of the blood hides the moon.The moon does not enter the blood.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
