 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. DATE:  4/9/96BEGIN TIME:  19:19END TIME:  19:37 FACILITATOR:  SarahThe threads of the carpet weave new cloud gowns for the moon. The threads are busy taking the light and twisting it into clothes that will not scratch the moon. They are too busy to talk with the mind.They understand what it is the moon wants.The mind does not understand what the moon wants.The carpet refuses Pepsi.The carpet refuses Doritos.Is the carpet not giving these gifts to the moon? Or does the moon want something else?___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
