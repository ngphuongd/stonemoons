  FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. From the Individualized Education Plan, Laurel Murphy. Last updated 8/5/96.This semester, we are going to try facilitated typing. We will use the MacIntosh Plus in the schoolroom and the MacClassic at home. At school, Ms. Lincoln or Ms. Abbot will watch for any interest in the computer. They will ask Laurel if she wants to type. An affirmative response will be a nod or sitting at the computer. At that point, they will open up the FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE folder and create a new document from the template. They will place their palm under Laurel's wrist, firmly, but allowing free movement. They will read aloud any words or sounds produced.Mom will do the same at home and bring in any work on a disk. Dr. Scratchard will examine these facilitated typing exercises at the end of the semester.It must be noted that the school's position is that this exercise will help Laurel understand the relationship between sounds and letters. We do not advocate this technique, nor do we believe it an accurate portrayal of Laurel's level of intelligence or output. The output from these exercises in no way reflect Laurel's thoughts or level of communication.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
