 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  12/17/96 BEGIN TIME:  13:32END TIME:  13:57FACILITATOR:  MarilynThe voice of the light matches the voice of the computer. The hums form a counterpoint to the ears. First the light hum whirs slantwise into the ears, then the computer hum comes in under the light hum. The hums drone through the ears and into the mind. The mind withers like the flesh kept too long on the candles. The mind does not like these hums. The mouth cries out make it stop make it stop make it stop.But the hums do not listen to the ears. Or the mouth. Or the mind. They keep on.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
