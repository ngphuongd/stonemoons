 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. DATE:  5/8/97 BEGIN TIME:  19:29END TIME:  20:01 FACILITATOR:  SarahThe grass outside starts to grow thick in the sunlight, weaving patterns of light and shade while the eyes stay still, watching.The eyes stay very still, like the tigers behind the tv. Wait for the prey to move first.But they do not catch the pattern moving.They do not find the moon in the pale stalks under the new sharp grass.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
