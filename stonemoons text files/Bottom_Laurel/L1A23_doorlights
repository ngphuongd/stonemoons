IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  11/26/96 BEGIN TIME:  19:06END TIME:  19:22FACILITATOR:  SarahThe front door has six diamond panes down the right hand side. They each have a beveled edge around a clear piece of glass. The beveled edges like the eyes. They watch for the mind and shine for the mind when the legs sit at the kitchen table, watching them.For the eyes, they change the colors of the lamp outside when the back rocks back and forth. First the brightest green the soul can find, like the flash at the edge of the sea. Then a luscious purple the soul could eat somehow. Then a deep cobalt blue, like electric shocks.But they will not change for the others. The eyes watch them when they are not looking, and they don't.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
