 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  9/23/96BEGIN TIME:  13:31END TIME:  13:59FACILITATOR:  CarrieClothes are ambivalent. They don't mind covering the legs and keeping the belly filled with their colors. But sometimes they just want to crawl off under the bed and be left alone.So they start scratching the arms, enticing the skin to riot into sparkles of panic. First one patch of skin explodes into infitesmal bits of pain. Then another patch bursts in, like dogs barking in succession down the street.And the fingers tear the clothes off to run from the pain.But the pain stays with the feet anyway.<---   --->______________________Sarah  / Moon  / Laurel______________________
