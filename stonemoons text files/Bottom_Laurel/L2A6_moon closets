IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  1/23/96 BEGIN TIME:  13:36END TIME:  14:22FACILITATOR:  CarrieThe moon wants her closet space. The whole large moon wants to slip down to become her silver sliver and go in and out of the space between the closet door and the wall, just like the sun does.The sun is safe because it can go in and out. The doors hold no danger for the sun. The sun can capture the door and be captured in the door. But the moon cannot find her closet.The moon is not safe.In the sun, when the mind cannot find the moon, the closet is safe for the mind's soul. But in the dark, when the moon can find the closet, nowhere is safe.So the eyes stay open, waiting for the moon to understand.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
