 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. DATE:  8/11/96BEGIN TIME:  19:17END TIME:  19:48FACILITATOR:  SarahThere is only one carpet. It just shifts its colors and thickens its textures to follow the feet into various rooms. The carpet can hear very well—even down to the roots of the thoughts in the mind. Even the thoughts in the mind of the moon. Even dreams when the dreams have left the mind. This is what happens. The moon weaves the carpet together. Each thread breathes with the other, moves with the other. Each thread understands all the other threads without having to think about anything first. The moon likes to lay there just listening to the carpet.And because they can understand each other, they will find the feet. Don't ever try to run away from a carpet. Because it will come back. And it will take the feet into rooms they don't like. Rooms where nothing understands. Where the mind cannot understand anything.<---  --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
