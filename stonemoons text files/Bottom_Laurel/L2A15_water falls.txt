 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  3/25/97BEGIN TIME:  18:59END TIME:  19:46FACILITATOR:  SarahThe water in the ocean does not come spilling out of the glass of the tv. It stays, rocking, rocking, until some other picture hustles it out of the way. Then it disappears until it is strong enough to meet the glass, rocking, rocking. The body rocks with it, a three:four beat to the kelp's five:eight tempo. The water understands. The hands fill the bathtub with the water. It is not the ocean of the tv. It is too small to rock. The legs rock with it anyway. It goes to talk the carpet. It does not stay with the body.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
