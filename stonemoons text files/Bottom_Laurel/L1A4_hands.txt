 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  8/19/96 BEGIN TIME:  19:29END TIME:  19:46FACILITATOR:  SarahThe hands are not a part of the body. The body is not a part of the mind. They are incidental accidents that move together when you are not looking.The hands leer at the arms. They rebel and refuse to understand the mind. They will not go where the soul wants to go.The dirty plastic keys refuse to hear the hands. They just go on talking to themselves and do not want the ears to hear their mutterings.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
