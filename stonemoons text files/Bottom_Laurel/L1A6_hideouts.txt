 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  8/26/96 BEGIN TIME:  19:32END TIME:  19:57FACILITATOR:  SarahIn the living room, the fingers stripped away the wallpaper and ate into the wall a bit with a spoon so that mice could hide there. The voice told the wall first, so it was ok.The hands dug into the bottom of the shower floor so water could hide if it was afraid of the drain.The body carved out a space behind the eyes for the spots in the air to go when they are tired.But the hiding places keep on being found. The moon needs to hide itself. Where can the moon go?<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
