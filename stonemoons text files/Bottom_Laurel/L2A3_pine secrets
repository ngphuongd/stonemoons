 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  12/24/96 BEGIN TIME:  19:42END TIME:  19:58FACILITATOR:  SarahThe smell of pine wreaths is beautiful in its ferocity. The clean white barefoot scent is the color of the moon when the mind cannot see her. Pine tastes a deep secret blue rain from the tv jungles. The scents attack like tigers in the night camera lit jungle, their muscles twitching as the prey does not see them.The glass of the tv does not guard the pine needles like it guards the tigers. The tigers can never get out of the tv. But the pine wreath was too smart to be caught in the tv.And it stays on the door of our house, watching the ground try to get in.The pine wreath will learn from the ground's mistakes.The pine wreath will get in.And it will take the feet into its dark rain mouth. And the body will melt.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
