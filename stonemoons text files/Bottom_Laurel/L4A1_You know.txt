The moon put the world together once. It fit like the workings of a moving mechanical jig-toy. Every gear meshed with every other gear. People touched and loved and laughed and ate in perfect sync with each other. But then one gear was born without teeth. It could not find the other gears. And so the world stopped. Fractured into a thousand shiny bits like the brittle edges of a compact disk.Then the moon gathered up the pieces. But she had forgotten how the puzzle went exactly. So she put it together all higgledy-piggledy. Sometimes things worked and sometimes things didn't. The moon was getting old and knew that she couldn't fix things a third time. So she told everyone not to mention the broken places. "If anything is         out of place," the voice of the moon said, "put it in an out-of-the-way corner and go on working as best you can. Only if you forget will you be happy."
