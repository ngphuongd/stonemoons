 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  10/11/96BEGIN TIME:  19:52END TIME:  20:10FACILITATOR:  SarahThe core of the earth gets tired of the mind of the earth, loathes it. And so the earth pushes pieces of the soul of the earth up through the outer edges of dirt and into the sunshine.These become trees, large veins of what the core can stand no longer. And the sun takes pity on them. They reach out to her, stealing her sunshine. But they never quite reach her.  This is the battle of yellow and green.Laying in arms of the trees is safe. It is good to love what the earth loathes. But when laying in the tree, hum loudly to make sure that the earth stays very far away. <---   --->______________________Sarah  / Moon  / Laurel______________________
