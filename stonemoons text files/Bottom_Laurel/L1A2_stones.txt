IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE. DATE:  8/5/96BEGIN TIME:  19:12END TIME:  19:39FACILITATOR:  SarahStones know how to keep the light going forever and ever. Look inside one just at the edge of the water and see the figures change and move. The scenes change and don't let the eyes alone, first the light figures, then the dark figures which hide under the shadows.But stones are not like videos. Videos know they must present each scene in order:  first one and then the next.Stones do not know this. And the scenes become a confused tapestry of repetition.<---   --->___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
