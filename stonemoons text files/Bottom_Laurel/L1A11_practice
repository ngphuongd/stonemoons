IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  9/11/96 BEGIN TIME:  13:36END TIME:  14:12FACILITATOR:  MarilynCats understand what it is to have a thousand sets of eyes. They blink back and forth between worlds, dreaming with white eyes open and blue eyes shut and then with any flicker of motion in the room, they pounce back into the world that needs blue eyes open and white eyes shut. The body practises this. Everyday the body practises this. Things have to be in the right order and the right way. And still the eyes attached to the mind cannot transfer from one world to the other with a twitch of the tail.It is because the eyes cannot see the tail. The eyes will have to try harder to find the tail that translates between the worlds.<---   --->___________________Sarah / Moon / Laurel___________________
