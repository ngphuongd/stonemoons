The skin is the door of the body. It keeps things in place.But the moon has found the door of the body. Even when the sun is here, the moon still lingers on the skin, coating the hairs of the skin with moon clouds.The moon needs to get in.Hit hit hit the skin.Make the flesh understand. Inside is not safe. The moon can find the flesh inside.Only when the blood pours from the flesh is the mind safe from the moon.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
