Crazy spaceship earth where anything can happen. And it usually does. I think I need a ticket off this planet. And yet where would I go? Ahh, the typical vacationer's dilemma. So happy am I that something in my life is typical.Anyway, anyway, anyway. Laurel is having her "little Christmas frenzies," as Mr. Maddox so quaintly put it, so we agreed to try a day program. I had to say ok, because they weren't giving me any other choice. So agree I guess I did. This is what it says on the papers. Consent given. After only four weeks on inaction (such speedy gonzales they said they were for me, most people take eight to twelve weeks for emergency placement*.) It is a lady willing to babysit/teach and her daughter. Which is cool—I mean I'm all for free enterprise. Just look at how I get babysitters.So the lady comes up to the door, reeking of cigarette smoke. (Have I mentioned before that whenever Laurel is exposed to cigarette smoke, she develops large hives and starts coughing? The coughs usually end up long and deep, keeping us all up nights for weeks on end.) And it is too late now to do anything, the school says we have to do this for a minimum trial period. (A stray thought wandered into my mind:  Wonder if they would force other kids to endure a classroom on top of a powerplant stack for a minimum trial period. . .but I banish this wispy thought immediately as unworthy.) I ask her if she smokes in the house. She says "Yeah, gotta problem with that?" I can say nothing—I am so mad. So she assumes I don't and leaves. Laurel's green and yellow ruffles droop slowly as she walks behind the lady.She brings Laurel back, and I can see the rash starting on Laurel's chin and down under the neckline of her dress. She says "The cutest thing happened. My daughter had a candy cigarette and said she was going to chill out with a smoke and gave your daughter one too. Your daughter held it just right." And the lady smiled and left. I called the school and said no more, no more. They said I was refusing recommended treatment and would not pay for anything else. Laurel is coughing now, and bringing up great hunks of blood. Already.Next year had better be better.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
