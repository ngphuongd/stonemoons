They settle down into the life they want to have. And it isn't really the mind at all. Just something else entirely.When cars are in a good mood, they let the feet enter. The head nods politely at the plush red velvet seats. The dark crossgrains of maroon seatbelts caress the belly, pressing in as though they could not stand to be away from the belly flesh for another tiny moment.Then others have to come into the car and the car decides where to go. Usually, it follows a familiar path:  grocery store, school, swimming pool.Then sometimes, it doesn't.<---   --->___________________Sarah / Moon / Laurel___________________
