I've got to go look for work; we need the money. With Laurel in respite care or a residential school, I could continue leading the two groups of Junior Great Books at Janet's school. And having some special time with Janet would be nice, too. And then maybe I could even get a bit of time in there to get a doctor to look at my aching side. The pain itself might even be persuaded to go away. That could be priceless.But...the district is paying the piper. So Mom has no real voice in whatever they decide to do with Laurel. This person will not know her special rules, her likes and dislikes as I do. So how can we get any sort of consistency—which is what Laurel truly needs to survive here on earth. Also, Laurel is scheduled to start new meds (Anafranil, aka clomipramine*) this week. I don't like the idea of her going on meds in a strange environment, where this person is not going to know whether his behavior is better than/worse than/same as before.And none of us can be sure if any behavioral changes are due to drugs or to change in environment. I can't see changing meds, school, and "home" all at the same time. Laurel just walked up to me and put her head down in my lap. Excuse me. I think we'll do some zorfs* now.##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
