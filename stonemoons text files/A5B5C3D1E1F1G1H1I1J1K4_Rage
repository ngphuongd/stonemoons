Sometimes I think that when I die my soul will turn into smoke, infesting the lungs of all around me.Then Laurel will feel me tickling through her bronchioles, carressing her alveoli. My essence will infuse the walls of her smallest capillaries, breathe into each platelet, cascade though her red blood, coursing into the depths of her being. My smoke will take refuge in her, leaving her without a refuge. Will she understand this?Will she be aware enough to feel her rage when my soul smoke dissolves her soul's protection?##goback##presson___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
