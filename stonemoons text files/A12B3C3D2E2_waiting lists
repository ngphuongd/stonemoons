NOTE:Waiting lists for each of Denver's three facilities for autistic adults are approximately 20 years.  According to this, if I enroll Laurel now, she will be at least 30 before she can get in.  I will be over 50. These are not numbers I like to calculate.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
