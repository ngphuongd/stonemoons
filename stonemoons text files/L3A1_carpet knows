The moon hides under the carpet in the day. The slivers of the moon cut the flesh of the feet so the feet cannot walk. The slivers infect the feet, drawing quick silver blood into the light.The moon dances, carving patterns of pain on the feet.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
