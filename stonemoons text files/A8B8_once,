Janet politely signalled with even spaced pains, waited patiently for the ambulance, and made her appearance just under a half an hour after I was prepped.   No complications there, and I brought her home quickly.The Catholic charity sent out ten girls in a row to help when Janet was born.  They would stream into the house, carrying oversize suitcases of blowdryers, torn jeans, and oversize sweatshirts.  They would stream back  out of the house carrying earplugs and clutching rosaries.  One lasted two hours.  Another 5 minutes. After a while, the girls stopped coming.Janet and I learned to live around the sounds of Laurel's screams.##Higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
