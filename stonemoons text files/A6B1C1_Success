Mrs. Stegall, Janet's second grade teacher, asked Janet for a special essay on "her special sister."  I almost gagged, but let Janet come up with something and send it in.  Mrs. Stegall is going to print it in the school newsletter and use it as a shining example of student writing.  She even suggested putting Janet in a gifted and talented class.  She says that the regular classroom* won't allow Janet to reach her full potential.   Janet says she wants to go to it because her best friend Carina is in it.  I said fine.  Janet can write quite well when she puts her mind to it—she would write a paragraph or so, go out to jump rope, come back in, go hang out on the tree (even in this frost—I think she talks to the snow gods or something and they keep her warm).  Then she would write a bit more.I asked her where she learned this piecemeal approach to writing, and she said, from you mommy.  Which, when I look at things around here, is nothing less than the absolute truth.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
