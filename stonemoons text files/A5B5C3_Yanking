I am going to put it down from the beginning.  Take a deep breath.  And scream later.I agreed to go along with the school's plans again this year to keep Laurel in an intensive private setting—with the stipulation that an aggressive plan for re-integration, with a specific time-table, be included in the IEP.  She was to have recess, P.E., and lunch with other kids.Laurel started the year in the big, sunny, special ed room.  She had two staff members assigned to her at all times, so that, if she were aggressive to one, the other could move in to intervene—and also, I suspect, so that if she ever did start communicating, or if her behavior worsened or she started playing with her genitals, they'd have a speaking witness to testify that their staff members never abused her.  That's okay by me.  I believe in the old saying that, "conscience is that still, small voice that tells you someone might be watching."I checked back periodically to see how the re-integration time-line was going.  I was told things were going "really well".  I never saw anything in writing.  I was informed that my frequent visits communicated a lack of faith in the staff.  They also said that my presence was disruptive to Laurel, who had "developed certain behavioral expectations" in my presence.  I was asked not to come by for at least a month.I continued to volunteer my time at the school—since I couldn't look for a real job and needed to be on hand anyway.  One morning, after doing a two-hour shift in the library, I decided to just peek in the door to see Laurel without her seeing me.  I had brought in cookies for Janet's class, and since they were a kind Laurel could have*, I wanted to bring her one.She didn't see me.  She wasn't there.  I asked where Laurel was, thinking I'd be told she was in P.E.. as that was what she was scheduled for.  Oh no, they told me. "She's in private therapy." They needed the big room for other things, so Laurel had been moved to a "private classroom."  I asked to see the room.  Laurel was in what had been a storage closet.  Sandwiched between the inner hallway and the special ed room, the ten by six foot space had no external doors and one non-opening window, permanently covered.  When I poked my head in, the only functioning door had been closed for some time.  The aide had hold of Laurel's wrist,  swirling her fingers in menthol shaving cream on a mirror.  The smell was overpowering, with no ventilation.  Laurel was completely limp and unfocused, clearly escaping the sensory assault the only way she could.I took Laurel in my arms and carried her up to the principal's office.  She was still groggy, unfocused. Waited outside his door while he met with a student. Then I barged in politely and asked for a minute of his time as it was an emergency.  I said huffily*, "Legally you need to give me ten days warning before substantively changing Laurel's education. Her IEP says that between two and three (it was 2:15) she will be integrating with the P.E. class.  Keeping Laurel in a room without ventilation and using toxic substances looks like a substantial change to her health, let alone her education. Why isn't her IEP being followed?"Mr. Maddox replied that "The school did not have enough staff to do the IEP as it was written, so we made a few minor changes."I took a deep breath and said, "I will come here and work, full time, every day, in any capacity that you need, so that you can make available the staff to do my daughter's program as it is written in her IEP."  The principal left the office.  A few minutes later, the social worker walked in.  She said, " I'm really sorry, but I've been told to tell you that you are being disruptive and you have to leave or you'll be arrested."It took a while to sink in.  Arrested for rescuing my daughter from noxious fumes?   Arrested for volunteering my servitude?  Disruptive for offering to give up my days so that they could be in compliance with the law?  So I left.And I took Laurel with me.##higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
