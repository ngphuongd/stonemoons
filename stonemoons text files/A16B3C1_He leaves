He rooms with four other med students in a tiny house on Capitol Hill.  You cringe when you have to walk up the broken cement steps, and just look at the brown grass, never cut, never watered, a broken tooth in this neat, trim neighborhood.  Because it is always somebody else at the door.  You look at the old lion knocker in the middle of the door and not into their faces. You mumble his name.  They say he isn't home.  You thank them.  You can never keep their names straight, and in fact, you think the names change. When he calls you back, he says, "Don't meet me at my house. The neighborhood is too dangerous."   Every time he calls you, you wonder if he says that to his mother.  You think about the alleys that lead up to Colfax, the dank puddles on the streets when everything else is dry.  The lingering remains of drunks and sex.  Then you stop thinking about it. Two years, and you have still never met his mother.  He tells you about her, shows you the cotton caftan she wove him for Christmas.  And you stop thinking about that, too.You go down on weekends when you can.  If he isn't there, well it isn't all that far to the Denver Public Library and you needed some stuff there anyway.  Then  you get an internship at Quantum Software in the Republic Building on the downtown mall as a junior tech editor.  This way, you can get your classes and all the studying in on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and go to Denver to work and have coffee with him afterwards on Tuesdays and Thursdays *. He does not invite you over.  He does, however, return your phone calls faithfully every Wednesday and Friday.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
