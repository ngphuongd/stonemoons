You miss a month.You have always been prompt—right at the start of the new moon. When you can see the dark hulk of the moon hiding beside the tiny curved opening of light, you always think to yourself:   I am shedding the dark blood of the moon. She keeps herself clean while I bear both our pain. You always see the moon laughing at every slow tide of blood rolling down into pain on the shores inside your body.  You always tell yourself this is nonsense. And, after the moon has established herself, you forgive the dark hulk behind her. Until the next month.But this time, the moon has dismissed you. The first night of the new moon is cloudy. You do not notice. The second is clear.You wait. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
