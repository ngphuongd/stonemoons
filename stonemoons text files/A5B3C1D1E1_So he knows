NOTE:Donna Williams wrote "Nobody Nowhere" in an attempt to understand herself.  She felt most comfortable with the label "autistic."  Anyway, she saw the same drawing from the autistic child that Bruno describes as a missing breast in the Empty Fortress.  She knew better—she had drawn the same picture repeatedly.  For her the picture showed her trap, the black distance between her world and the real world.  The hole was herself and the black space the impossible distance between her understanding and the world's expectations  (page 101).Williams, Donna, 1992.
