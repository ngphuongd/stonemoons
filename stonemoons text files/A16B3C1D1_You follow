To:   Sarah MurphyFrom:   SarahSubject:   Memory filesDateLine:   June 1986Your internship paves the way for a full time position in Quantum the day you graduate.   You like the people, the pay isn't bad, and you have your very own grey cubicle in a warren of other cubicles on the fifteenth floor.  On a clear day, if you go over to Sue's desk, you can see the Front Range from Mt. Evans to Long's Peak.  Congratulations, your clasmates say enviously. It is so damn hard to get a job with a B.A. in English. Lucky damn stiff, they whisper to each other.  Sold out, some say.  You ignore it. Or just shrug to acknowledge your luck—which it is even if it isn't what you want to do for the rest of your life. You get an apartment in Denver, right in the thick of Capitol Hill, about two blocks from his house of crazy med interns.  (We rotate beds, he tells you. Two of the guys are residents and only need the one bed. You probably don't believe him.)It's a studio, in what used to be part of the servants quarters in what was once a snappy neighborhood. But that was back way before 1920, as the art deco ceilings and thick plastered ivy mouldings on arched entryways proclaim. Now, it is nothing. Still, you feel a sense of the snaz as you write the address:   Emily Dickinson, Apt. 208. The names have probably been around since the origin—or so long that no one finds it humorous that Emily is a tiny white stone building scrunched in between the heavy brick pillars of Nathanial Hawthorne and the black marble slabs of Mark Twain.You call him from work, even before your own phone is set up. "Come over and see my new place," you try to purr. You want your voice seductive, sweet. It sounds like you have just finished a hog calling contest. And lost.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
