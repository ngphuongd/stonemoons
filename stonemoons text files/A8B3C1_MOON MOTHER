Old Moon, I need to tell you. You have twisted the ancient legends so far from the truth that we can no longer recognize our creator. You, with your endlessly changing faces, your silvering but never aging body, are the mother to the fates. Virgin, mother, crone all spin their entrails and cut their threads from your template.I understand this. I see you so clearly, the full eye between clouds that change from laughing lights to burning dragons in a heart's moment. Now that I have divined your secret, I can only ask once again, knowing this time you will hear me:  Give her back.##Moon##Sarah__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
