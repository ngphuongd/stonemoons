They all came over to Laurel's classroom to see her and sing carols with her.  Laurel promptly fled into the closet and refused to come out.  (I had to stay at the school until about 8 that night before we could get Laurel to budge).They wanted to bake cookies for Laurel, but I explained that Laurel was on a special diet—due to the various allergies and medications, etc.  So that was out.  Then Karen, Suzie's mom, got a great idea.  Now they are going to hold bake sales so that Laurel can afford the auditory integration therapy I wanted for her—at $50 a session, 2 sessions a day for 10 days—or a grand unreachable total of  $1,000.  Somehow,  I didn't get around to telling them there was no way they could earn enough money for the whole treatment —and I don't know anywhere where I can get the rest.  But we'll put it in a trust fund or something to see what we can get.  A little start is much better than no start at all, as Karen is continually saying.So Karen and I wrote a flyer to introduce Laurel and all of the circumstances. Kim's father runs Coyote printing and printed up 3,000 copies for free.   Jessica's mother is the vice-president of Colorado National Trust Bank and set up an account for the money.  Juliette's mother runs the Ladies Christian Aid Society out of Most Precious Blood and she got all of the ladies to do a corresponding bake and craft sale at the church. So it really became a muli-family affair.  Each troop made christmas tree ornaments and yarn dolls and Melody's grandmother tried to teach the kids how to tat white thread snowflakes, but these didn't come out so well.  Then each girl baked something (we had more Rice Krispie Treats than we knew what to do with).  So we had lots of crafts and baked goods.  The kids set up all over the neighborhood—in the school during lunch, inside Safeway (once the manager heard who this was for, he even set up chairs and tables for the kids), at the school Christmas play, in the high school, and some enterprising ones went door to door.Upshot of the whole affair?  A net profit of $467.19!  My eyes bugged out when Jessica's mom showed me the bank balance.  I still don't know her name.  This was incredible.But you know, it was more than the money.  The principle of this thing will keep me high for months!##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
