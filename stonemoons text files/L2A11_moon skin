But the mind of the moon is no longer in the skin.The dust understands this. And stays away from the lights where the mind of the moon lies hidden between the humming pulses.The others do not understand this. They move under the light.They call my feet under the light, which is the new skin for the moon.The new skin will break.The flesh of the moon will cut the skin.And the mind will have no place to hide.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
