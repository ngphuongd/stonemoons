NOTE:And what is love if it isn't hurling yourself onto an eighty-pound terror, trying to keep her from hurtling into the Yale and Monaco intersection? This, I think ranks up there with the heroic love of Demeter, searching the world over twice for her daughter, and plunging into hell when she had to.I do these things because I want my daughter. As she is, as she has been, and as she will be, whatever.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
