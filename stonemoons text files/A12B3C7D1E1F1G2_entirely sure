She needed me to see through her eyes. She needed someone to understand. So she lent me some weed and an old pair of glasses.Properly blurred, we turned into the tunnel between concourses B and C of Chicago's O'Hare Airport. There ought to be a warning posted:  The light show you are about to see could cause orgasmic understanding. Stay on the moving sidewalk. Do not look up or to the side. But this is what most people don't look around or experience anything anyway, so why bother?The first time through, the neon threads hanging below the ceiling threatened my eyes with their infinite possibilities. So I shaded my eyes and looked only at the fluted walls:  the thick milky colors floating past. It probably took four trips and maybe ten more tokes before I could find the courage to stare at the ceiling, with its dragon-cache of mirrored neon rainbows. That's when I knew for sure.##Higher##Further##Back##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
