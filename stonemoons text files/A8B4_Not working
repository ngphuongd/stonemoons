You could be a spelunker and find a thousand caves filled with coins of gold (or at the very least pogs of skull and pirate faces).  You could dive from heights unknown to man and land on neatly made beds.   Hold it right there.  I think the neatly made beds part is a mommy fantasy, and one the kids would not appreciate.  After all, who would WANT to be the mommy during summer vacation?  Jack Cooper came by to play with Janet at a quarter of seven in the evening.  It was still plenty light, so I said that they could go outside for a little bit.  Laurel toddled along behind them, wanting to be in on the fun.  I pulled on some shoes and followed all of them out, with my hair unbrushed and no bra.  Laurel immediately took off for the school, and Janet and Jack followed her.  Which would have been fine, except that there was an open school board meeting going on, and the doors were unlocked. Jack, curious, threw the door open and in Laurel went, to her old room. She played on the computer, and that would have been fine, except that she decided she needed to go through the window.  This, too, would have been fine, except that someone had been revarnishing the window and it would not open all the way.  So she was stuck half way through.I spent a good deal of time waiting for her to back out. Laurel refused to move.  Finally, I pulled her away from the outside and Janet closed the window. Unable to get back out the window, Laurel pinched me, then knocked my glasses flying along with a handful of my hair.  She grabbed a double handful of hair and pulled me to the ground, while she turned onto her back, still holding my hair, and kicked me in the face and stomach. I had to cover her mouth and nose to get her to let go. After she got up, she continued screaming, and wouldn't the school meeting happen to be getting out just then. You should have seen the looks I got from the other mothers. I'm going to hear about the looks* later. On the way home, Janet periodically lunged for my breasts, pinching them viciously. Boy, that's effective. I jumped around her and walked on ahead, and she followed. She was pretty much calm by the time we got home. I made her go to her room anyway. She was mad, and screamed and beat on the doors. Her hands were tattered shreds of skin by the time she was calm enough for me to go in.I don't think the Anafranil is working. Her OCD* has escalated since she's been on it, and her aggression increased this past week. The psychiatrist raised her dosage. But I just don't think that's it. I don't know what to do. The thing is, it's mostly these breaks in structure that precipitate the problem, so I don't think there would be such a problem in a highly structured environment. How do you explain the summer vacation? Especially when the last time she was out was the long "break" in the middle of last year as the school couldn't get its act together to save its ass.I try for a consistent home schedule. We attempt to wake up at the same time, do exercises at the same time, etc. But it is nowhere near what she can get in a school, with bells, other classes, and all the frenetic yet ordered activities.Face it, I can't guarantee a constant, consistent, highly structured environment outside of school. The boundaries are too vague to really set anything up. Further, the outside errands (grocery shopping, gas, etc.) are low structure, high random events. Going for a walk is a vague sort of thing—even if you do it at the same time each evening. And that's when most of the aggression is happening.I guess what I really want is to abolish summer vacations, weekends, and any other stray aberrations from the schedule.Feedback guys?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
