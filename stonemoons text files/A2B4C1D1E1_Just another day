I got Laurel everything she wanted until we came to the candy aisle. She wanted Reese's peanut butter cups. She's violently allergic to peanut butter, but no matter, obviously the thick sweet stuff has nothing to do with the belly-rendering and scream erupting tornadoes later. I offered her Rolos, I offered her Snickers, I pointed out Mars bars and Starbursts and Milky Ways, but I signed our "no" to the Reeses. So she began attacking me. Ham-fisting me in the face over and over. Pulling my hair. Kicking me. She scratched my face up and I was bleeding. She had my blood smeared on her face. (I was afraid I had been so angry I'd hit her without realizing it, in kind of a mini-berserker rage. But it was ok—it was only my blood.) So I told Janet to ask for some tissues and a wet clean up and gave her the credit card to pay for what we had. I hoped wildly it wasn't the maxed out one. You think of the oddest things in the arms of the storm.My plan was to get Laurel out of the store as soon as possible. But Laurel decided she wanted chips and Pepsi, so we were going through the checkout line, period. She still kept roaring and attacking me every minute or so in the check-out line. You'd think the people would have offered to let me go on ahead, but they were kind of busy not staring, I think. Janet handed me back the credit card. Laurel intercepted and threw it at the clerk, barely missing his eye.  The clerk calmly took it, noted the numbers, handed Laurel the chips and Pepsi, and I scrawled something out on the piece of paper.  You would think this was an everyday occurrence for this guy. Which, I dunno, it might be.  I guided Laurel out, all the while she was screaming and throwing herself on the ground and hitting with the Pepsi cans and grabbing my hair or hitting my face.A man came up behind us and said, "Your mother loves you." I have not idea what he looks like or who he was. I couldn't drop my shields for long enough to look at him. I couldn't even wonder at the time why he didn't just get us a damp rag or a pair of cuffs or a circus elephant or something useful like that.We got home and Laurel jumped out of the car and went for me again. I knocked her on the ground, grabbed her hair, pulled her head back and smacked her. I know. Now you all know what an ogre I am. I put her in her room. Then I went and got a cup of cold water, and then unlocked her door. She threatened to come after me, but every time, I'd hold the cup up, and she'd back away. She spends hours a day in the shower, but she does not like getting splashed.God, am I feeling melodramatic and sorry for myself. I want to say I'm sorry for alarming everybody, but I'm not capable of being sorry for anyone but me right now. Nobody's terminally ill. We have a place to stay and food in the cupboard. And, of course, I have all of you, but it's not the same as a real flesh-and-blood shoulder to cry on, or better yet, babysitter, is it?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
