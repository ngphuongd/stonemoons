The others you hear are all twisted variations, passed down by those who cannot remember.At first, only the dark existed. She twirled nothingness into fantastic patterns of shade and shadow. And no one could see them—not even the dark herself. She became bored with the unseen patterns, the atom-chilling loneliness of chaos. Of emptiness.Slowly, she gathered strength into her, taking on form, substance. She created blood to swirl inside her, beating out patterns of breath, into her and out of her. For a long time, this was enough. When she became bored again, she reached outside of herself and shaped the earth. And her thoughts became embodied in the darkness:  thoughts of the sea moving in and out with her own breath. Of creatures breathing in the sea water. Of land for the sea to beat against. Of creatures breathing in the thin air. For a long time, this was enough. When the creatures stumbled against each other in the dark, she laughed. Finally, they came to her and asked her for light. "We are tired of feeling," they said. "We want to see."The darkness nodded. She breathed into her very bones, causing them to glow like old, nearly abandoned coals. And she glowed pearl silver, so light that the clouds around her took on the glow, clothing the sky about her in streamy, loving patterns. The patterns changed as you watched them, and the animals sat for a long time, entranced. And    so the darkness became the moon.But this was not enough. The animals convened a hearing. "We want what we do not have, we will die without it " they told themselves. "We will create ourselves into light, just as the dark has created herself into moon."All the animals held their breath and blew in on themselves. And their wind was so great that they blew half the animals into the sky, where they glowed with such a fire that nothing remained in darkness. Even the dark moon fled. The rest of the animals found they, too, had changed. Now they all stood upright on two tiny pins, they all clothed themselves and needed to hunt each other to eat. So they hunted each other, and called themselves the people. They cried to the moon "Help us in our misery! We cannot go on with the light!" And the light the animals had made sank into the ground. And the dark moon rose.  But she was no longer purely dark, nor did she glow with the beautiful light she had once had.  Now she was too weak to hide all of the hideous light of the people. "You have taken my strength, my people. For centuries hence I must spend most of my time rebuilding my own body. But I will do what I can," she cried. The moon gathered her full strength (which, in truth, was very little now) and turned some of the people back into animals. These were grateful, and paid their respect to the moon. But some of the people liked living as loathsome people and did not want to go back to the old animal ways, and so each time the moon has her strength, they hide.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
