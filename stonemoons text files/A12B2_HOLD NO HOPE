Besides, she still could not find the way to make the words back into reality. Only with the people's help could she return the universe to the way it was supposed to be. So she made the box impossibly small, compressing the atoms until no one would ever suspect their existence.She placed the box in the hearts of prophets. And the prophets were driven into frenzies, calling out dreams of oracles, mixing creatures with universes, portents of politics with omens of religion. The people called what the prophets wrote wisdom and followed it the best they could.She placed the box into the hands of kings and queens. But they ignored it completely in their rushes toward power. She gave it to courtiers, who gave her bad poetry instead. She gave it to plowmen, who could not take the time from their plowing to understand. She gave it to women who ed out its words as they gave birth, and later forgot that anything had added to their searing pain.She gave it to children who could understand. And they ended up as lunatics, unable to speak of what they had seen.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
