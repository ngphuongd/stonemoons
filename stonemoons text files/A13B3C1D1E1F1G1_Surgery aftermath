A-nonny-mouse for leaving the groceries (with all the correct foods*ÑI appreciate it so much!) and the good books (which I will get to sometime, I always have wanted to read the latest Tony Hillerman when it was still in hardback...) and the stuffed mouse for Laurel and the whack-a-mouse game for Janet. They are great.  While the girls got the toys, I got the joke and the laugh.  Thanks for the good wishes, the flowers (spring in the form of red and gold tulips, hyacinth, and daffodils  delivered right to my doorÑyou guys are fantastic).To reply to inquiries, I'll sum them up in an FAQ:>It occurs to me, what with your carrying Laurel all over the place, that you >are recovered (as least mostly) from surgery. That is debatable. A more relevant question might be, "What are my options?"  I really have to carry Laurel around from place to place.  She can walk, but she often won't. I have to pick her up and put her in her room when she gets out of hand.  I have tried, but I can think of no other way to get her to stop throwing glass out the window,  putting videos in the microwave, disabling the lock and running out.I need to look after my weight. The whole family has been on an allergy-free diet since early January, which seems to be calming Laurel down. Once Janet got over the sugar craving for Lucky Charms, she is doing ok. I've lost a couple of pounds. Nothing spectacular. Laurel has gotten betterÑbut obviously not enough.I still need to recover from the surgeryÑthe sutures are torn out and are inflamed pretty badly. It hurts to stand up. (So don't stand up, I hear all you would-be comics out there...) Just before I get to a fully standing position, I get a tearing sensation across my bikini line. (Like I would ever wear a bikini. It's a descriptor.) Eventually, there will be hernia surgery, I don't doubt. I wish I could work out some place good so I would be more able to handle these things. Perhaps I'll talk to my doctor about it soon. When I'm not totally up to my arse in alligators... .>What were the results of the surgery?  Will you have to go in for more?Dr. Michelson's staff called me yesterday with the results.  It turns out to be a large, but benign cyst.  Thank god, sometimes a cyst is just a cyst*...>How are you going to pay the doctor bills?God only knows.  I have no insurance at the moment, so things are gonna get strange.  But I figure I'm already in so much debt that a little more won't matter.  After all, what can they do? eat me?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
