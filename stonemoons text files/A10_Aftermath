I spent ten minutes outside her door, wondering if I should go in or not. Her jaw is wired shut and the bruises on her arm look like purple wood paneling. I set down my flowers and ran out crying. What to do? How do you say, "Look, I'm sorry that my daughter almost killed you?"I just got a call from the principal notifying me that Laurel was suspended for 10 days. For starters. (They are starting the illegal bullshit again. Legally, they have to give me 10 days notice of a prolonged suspension but they didn't.)  The letter also stated curtly that decisions for Laurel's future would be made on the 26th, which is actually 2 weeks away.   Laurel can't go to school before the meeting (another slight illegality, but who's counting?)So now I have Laurel 24 hours a day. This means I have to miss at least a week from looking for work. The zero income is going to hurt quite a bit now.  Not to mention I have zero time to prepare to have Laurel at home.  Not one hour of respite.  And we can't even go out grocery shopping without having dangerous attacks.And federal law states that you can't suspend a child for behaviors related to a disability. I mentioned this to Mr Maddox, the principal, and he said, "It's not for the behaviors. It's for injuring staff." I called the Association for Community Living. Got the voice mail of the one and only advocate for Arapahoe and Douglas counties, saying she is totally booked through the end of February. Of next year.##continue####delve deeper##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
