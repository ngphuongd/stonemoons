She twirls around in the middle of the loving room floor until she is too dizzy to stand.  Then she plops down anywhere and sits quietly.  I think I can still see her eyes spinning sometimes.Anyway, Janet has taken a motherly interest in seeing that Laurel stays healthy.   She has devised an exercise program.  At first, I thought this was cute and sweet and utterly harmless.  It seems I still have a lot to learn about children (and here I thought I was in the advanced class).Janet is teaching Laurel how to climb walls.  You start with one foot on the air vent, put both hands on the walls, put other foot up on the wall, use that to prop yourself  up, and presto! all four digits are on a vertical surface. From there you can climb over to the sofa, bounce a couple of times, and come down on the other side of the wall.  If you push yourself off the sofa at just the right angle, you can safely propel yourself to the floor and declare yourself a champion wall climber.  If you miscalculate the trajectory, you will not have the breath to say anything.I told Janet that climbing walls was probably not a good thing to do until at least a month after you were out of a cast.  She took me seriously and marked the date that Laurel could climb walls on the calendar.  I think I am hoping she will just forget about it by then.  And that the adventure du jour then is not quite as haphazardly dangerous to flesh and furniture.How much do padded rooms cost, anyway?  And are they cheaper if you buy two?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
