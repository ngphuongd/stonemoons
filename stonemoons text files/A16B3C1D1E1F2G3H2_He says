As long as the words stay the same, you are safe.Over the Thursday coffees*, he simply holds your hand. Which is odd, because he certainly has held more than that in your apartment*.  And you both know that that is where you will end up again that night.  But right now, you think only about running your hands over his smooth legs.  And you have lost the conversation.You think he says he loves you. But you aren't sure because his hand is over his mouth and he is staring back at the waitress, trying to wave her over for more coffe.You nod.  But his back is to you, there is no one to see you nod.  You fiddle with the empty cream containers, putting them back into each other like russian dolls.  Putting everything in place.You think he says there is no one else but you.  He is drinking his coffee though, and may be muttering about something else.  You tell yourself this is what you have heard.  He says he is too busy right now with med school to think of settling down.  You nod and go off on a tangent, talking about the office politics and Sue's new haircut. You, too, are busy.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
