These are the tributes the moon requires.  She bends the tides into her majestic dances, so slow and so large that she alone can fathom their complexity.  She commands the blood in our bodies, figuring each corpuscle into its own quadrille.  Fashioning our breath into her being, she shapes each action, requires each reaction.Thus are we powerless before her.  Thus we go out as we came in.  This is the terror in the necronomicons, this the hidden horror under the instructions to turn three times in the moonlight and say our Ave Marias and paternosters backwards.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
