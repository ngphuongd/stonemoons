 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  1/13/97 BEGIN TIME:  13:34END TIME:  14:01FACILITATOR:  Marilyn The eyes see the other face behind the colors of the cd. The face and the eyes rock in sync, the same air currents of dust part for both.The eyes stare at the other eyes. They do not move back and forth. They stay steady like dark brown mountains. They hold back the colors. They make it safe. Everything is safe.Then the others, the human people touch the cd. Bend the light. Make the eyes move up. This is not safe. This breaks the dark mountains and the moon can come in whenever she wants to. The mind's soul wants the moon to stay away. The mind wants the cd safe. No, No. No, No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Stay Away No.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
