When you believe premise a, then premise b causally follows. The conclusion stems from the tautology:   a = b, b = not c, therefore not c. The logic, my friend, has always been inescapable.Pain is of the mind.The mind refuses to acknowledge the pain.Therefore, there is no pain.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
