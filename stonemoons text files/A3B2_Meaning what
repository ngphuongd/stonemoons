Just being curious.Dad said he thought I had other things on my mind that day and didn't need to hear that story. I explained to him that it meant a lot to me to know that he knew some of what I went through. He said he admires the commitment I have to my kids, and the patience I show with both of them. :  *)I hung up the phone and hugged Janet.  She asked me what that was for, and I told her that I appreciated, loved, and admired her.  I told Laurel the same thing.
