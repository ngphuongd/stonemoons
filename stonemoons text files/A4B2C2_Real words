Like a chimerical butterfly, she goes from comm book to facilitated typing sessions to workbook to calm walks to the gas station.  This has been the most fantastic summer I have ever had.I got the Intellitype facilitated communication keyboard and program and hooked it into my Mac, and we have been using it every day.  At first, Laurel was upset when she made a mistake (either in typing or capping or spacing.  Everything had to be perfect, and if she hit the wrong key, then she would howl and keen and rush off to bang her head against the refrigerator.  We never got an entire word out.   Finally, today, Chris played facilitated typing with Janet, and Janet (having been coached very carefully ahead of time) made several mistakes.  Each time Janet made a mistake, she said "ok, hit delete, hit delete" and would make a BIG deal of going over to the delete* key, with Chris' hand supporting her finger. Laurel watched this from the kitchen out of the corner of her eye, wary of these people who were in her space, taking up her talking board.  Then she rocked very carefully and deliberately, holding Chris' hand and pressing nonexistent keys on the refrigerator.  After Chris got her a grape popsicle, Laurel put the popsicle on top of the monitor and grabbed Chris' hand.They started to type.  I didn't even dare to rescue the monitor from sure stickiness.  Laurel typed in "i" then hit the delete key and held down the cap lock for "I" then released the cap lock and typed in "lov3e".  Went back and erased the "3" and the "e," made it "love" and went on for the "you."  When she had this, she tried to take up the grape popsicle (but this had melted into the computer long before).  She howled.  I gave her a new popsicle, and she touched the back of my hand, blowing into my face.  Chris stood back and watched.  The tears in all our faces were just too much to bear.  So we put the swing icon on the "This is what is going to happen now" page in Laurel's comm book and went out into the sunshine.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
