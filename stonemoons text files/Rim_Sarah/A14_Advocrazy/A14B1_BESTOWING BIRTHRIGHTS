To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Truth filesThe night Laurel was born, the moon came for her. The moon drifted toward her as she lay sleeping in the hospital bed that first night. She was next to the window, in a little isolette, her tiny hands waving as she struggled under the oxygen.The moon crept across her pillow. Whispered in her ear ~ what promises of hers held truth and what held merely echos of echos, the moon herself did not know. The moon took the box covered in moonstone, locked five times, and then welded shut. Shook it in front of Laurel, who probably giggled and reached for it ~ just as she now reaches for anything shiny.The moon pressed her box of words, the whole wisdom of the universe, to Laurel's breast. And the cells of my Laurel entered the atoms of the box. Together, she and the moon understood.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
