For instance, I finally took a shower for the first time in about three weeks.  Laurel was actually asleep (or near enough, I think I told you that right now she sleeps with her eyes wide open.  She will lie still for about a half hour before bolting upright in bed.  After that, she'll either get up or lie there some more.)  Anyway,  yesterday noon Laurel had been down for 15 minutes, so I figured I had time for a 10 minute shower.  I get the shampoo in my hair, lathered up through my fingers when I hear the door open and close.  I ran out of the shower, grabbed a towel and the car keys and headed down the street.  Mrs. Macdougal came out and threatened to call the cops for my indecent exposure, but I ignored her, gathered up Laurel about two houses from the witch's yard, and came back.  I still have the shampoo in my hair*.Anyway, this is the fourth time I've written this letter.  And I think the last six letters I actually finished went somewhere off into the netherworld of cyberspace. (I didn't get any answer, at any rate.) Serious question folks, where do the squiggly little lines go when they die? Do words have souls? Or is it the word itself that has a soul and not the specific instantation of it?Funny how we cling to the Internet like a lifeline just because it is possible to snatch a few minutes and write something when snatching a few hours to see you is so far out of the orbit of questionable reality. And then when the lifeline snaps, it doesn't even have the decency to tell you or to look at all shame-faced. Capricious little things, these boxes with telepathic green men that have invaded our lives without full disclosure and consent.Anyway, what I wrote, what is missing, isn't something I can readily call back. It was all my thoughts and understandings and little tidbits of an earlier version of reality.Can y'all go saddle up the horses and round them up in the vast lost reaches of the cyber frontier? I'd be mighty obliged to ya.  You'll know the ones I want because they were all shiny new, with odd-shaped edges.Nothing at all like tears. Which are round, and not so shiny, in case anyone out there forgot.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
