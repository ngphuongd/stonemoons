(Ye zooks! Call out the cops, the woman actually has time to think!) Anyway, the bit about how can the mother love that child really bothered me. "How will you show the love," the guy asked. I dunno. How does anyone show it?I think my tender, intimate moments with Laurel are not dramatic*. They are the quiet minutes or hours on a Sunday morning when we have nothing to do but lie in bed, snuggling, tickling and zorfing*. Nothing "important" happens. The intimacy of a relationship with an autistic person is a profoundly private thing. Last night, Laurel stayed up late (until 10:30 at night.) She sat next to me on the couch as we watched The Muppet Christmas Show. Next to me. Not three inches away from the tv screen, staring slantwise. Her fingers were only two inches from me. Laurel got up at 6:30 the next morning (about an hour to an hour and a half early). She scooted up next to me on the bed and leaned her head on my shoulder. Nothing more. How will you put these practical demonstrations of love into your book? How do you define those three enigmatic words, "I love you?" They are defiantly simple. The intensity of emotion is in what is not displayed and in their brevity.  How can you put a loving into a book when it is antipathetical to words? Nyah, nyah. That's your problem.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
