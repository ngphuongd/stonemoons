She gently, slowly touched her finger to the back of my neck, tracing the edges of my hair. I didn't move. I didn't even breathe for fear I'd break the spell. And just like the chipmunk who steals up beside you for those half-forgotten M&M's you left, she ran once she'd grasped her treat fully.Do you remember in Rainman, when Charlie (Tom Cruise) tries to hug Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and Raymond screams as though in pain? And Charlie near-sobs, "I just wanted to hug you. Just a little hug" or words to that effect? Later, Raymond touches his forehead to Charlie's, not even looking him in the eye, and strokes him awkwardly, more like he's wiping his effect away? And almost at the end, Raymond touches his forehead to Charlie's, not even looking him in the eye, and strokes him awkwardly, more like he's wiping his hands, and it's so incredibly touching. Even the most tacit acknowledgment that someone else exists represents a great vulnerability for these people. It means, "My world includes you. If something happens to you, my world will be broken." They are excruciatingly fragile. I keep thinking about that critique of Stone Moons, saying that you never see the affection between mother and child. It's true. Maybe the inability to express the love makes it that much more fierce. I have conversations with Laurel in my mind, and do things with her in my fantasies that we cannot do in "real life." I bet she has similar fantasies.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
