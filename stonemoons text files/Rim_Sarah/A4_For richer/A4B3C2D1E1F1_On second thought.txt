Even the wisps of her touch behind your back, the nights you wake up and see her hanging on the bookshelf by your bed just staring at you are worthy of a trot upon the boards. You don't stage moments like that. No one whispers any prompt. There are no scripts, no words to follow.But I whisper the words anyway. Well, I mean to whisper. But I shout them so they will pierce the ceiling and find the sky:   I LOVE YOU LAUREL. I LOVE YOU JANET.Of course, Janet shouts back. I LOVE YOU MOMMY. And this is good. We run slow-mo to each other—she from the back yard and I from the porch, and hug. And giggle in the grass.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
