But she did it anyway, with so little regard for your kind ears...or mine, for that matter ;) . Now, now, before panicking... I'll just commence a tellin' it, k?About 7 o'clock this morning, I feel a tug on my hand.  Laurel had her comm book out, and put a candy bar and a swing in the "This is what is going to happen now"  page.  So she waited patiently as Janet and I got dressed and found the wallet, shoes (one tennis shoe, one high heel), dog leash, and car keys.  Properly equipped, we walked to the playground.  Janet and I played ring around the rosy by ourselves as there was no one else around on that frosty morning.  Laurel swung happily for about 15 minutes, and even looked at me, playing peek-a-boo under her legs. I laughed.  She hummed, grabbed my hand, and we were off again. The gas station was open and Laurel led the procession inside.  She got her package of Starbursts with "her" money from her own fanny pack. This time, she actually pulled the money out of the pack before handing the whole thing over to the clerk. A very large incremental improvement!  He laughed.  I laughed again.  Laurel hummed. Grabbed my hand and before you know it, she was struggling out into the intersection.I ran after her, grabbed her by the middle, and pulled. She strained her entire 80 pounds against me, writhing from my grasp. I told Janet to go get help, and Janet went back into the gas station.  I turned Laurel so she was on the sidewalk and I was on the street. (I just did this, I didn't think before or after, but it is nice to know maternal instincts still just kick in and adapt to modern technology.)  Anyway, a cop came by (summoned by the trusty gas attendant) and saw immediately what was going on. I yelled at him to help save my daughter from going in the street.  He came over and stopped traffic with one hand while pushing Laurel with the other.  With one terrific heave, Laurel ran out of our grasps and into the front seat of the cop car.  Buckled herself in.  Gave her whole fanny pack to the officer.He offered us a ride, and I gathered up Janet from the gas station and climbed in back.Hey, I didn't even lose one hair on the top of my tinny tin head! We did good.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
