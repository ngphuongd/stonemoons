Because it isn't.Drama is better with the boring parts cut out. But sometimes the best part of life is the boring stuff:  ¤ Cuddling up close on a Sunday morning when the sun streams through her hair¤ Wandering through the meadow of purple sweetpeas by the canal¤ Taking in long uneventful evenings with James and the Giant Peach¤ Luxuriating in quiet breakfasts when she smiles at the milk in her glass¤  Settling in long walks at twilight when we hum at the moon.I get those, too.##continue##delve deeper ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
