Laurel is still staring quietly into the moonstone she hides from me at night under her pillow. I look at her. She looks through me.In my daughter's world, I think light transfigures everything. There she sees into the dust of dustmotes, into the atoms of atoms. For her, light is made flesh and dances in a thousand intricate prisms through the air. This is what is left after the moon's light slips off the horizon.##moon##sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
