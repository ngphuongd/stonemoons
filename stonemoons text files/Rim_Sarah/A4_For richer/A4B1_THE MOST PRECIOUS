She tore open her skin and dribbled her hands into her flesh.  She drew the ink from her own blood, still heavy from giving birth to the entire universe.  She made her pen from her own hair, long and silver strands that rested on the sea, billowing with the breath of the waves. The parchment she stretched from her own fair skin , sacrificing swaths of her thin covering, revealing the bone-white stones beneath.Thus she made ready to write.##goback##presson___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
