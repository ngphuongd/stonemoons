NOTE:Janet and I were walking out by the Highline canal, and Laurel was peacefully running in circles beside us.  I asked Janet who she was, how did she define herself at school?She said that sometimes at school she would say she was Laurel's sister, because everyone knew Laurel.  The teachers would say, well, you certainly are as pretty as Laurel.  One old witch* told her that she was so much better behaved that there was no way that she and Laurel could be related.  I asked Janet again, who she was.  Who would she be without Laurel?  Janet shrugged and waded into the shallow part of the canal, reaching for a cattail.  Snapped it off with a force that left half of the roots exposed.  Twirling it  like a baton, she came back to me.   I define myself as Janet Murphy that's all I can say, she said, and twisted the cattail very slightly, so a velvet explosion of seeds emerged and spilled off her hand.  I asked her who Janet Murphy was.  She blew the seeds toward the sun, toward Laurel.I dunno, she said. M aybe just:Spelling bee champ.The girl with the purple toenail polish.The kid with the best time on the 50 yard dash.The kid that Amanda always picks on.Laurel watched her as the millions of seeds blew out from the single stalk, fascinated.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
