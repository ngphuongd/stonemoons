NOTE:When I took Janet to her schol after I dropped Laurel off, I asked her what she thought when Laurel was so violent.  Was she scared?"A bit," she said.  "It means you have to pay a lot of attention to Laurel, it means that you could get hurt worse sometimes if I am there.  So I run downstairs and watch tv."We were quiet for a moment, watching the traffic pass us.  When we stopped at a red light, Janet added:  "I try to be the person on the tv.  I try to pretend that what is going on upstairs is just another channel.  It is just more and more fake blood.  I watch a comedy and pretend that I have changed the channel upstairs, too."I reached over and squeezed her hand.  "I do that too," I said.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
