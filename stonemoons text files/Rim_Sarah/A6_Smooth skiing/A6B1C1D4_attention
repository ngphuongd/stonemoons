NOTE:How many children do I have?I'm going to have time for Janet.  But Laurel needs me right now.  I keep hearing about how urgent Laurel's situation is, how intensive, early intervention is the only hope for her.  And there is hope, I am assured.  But it takes a lot.  Either it's expensive, or it takes every waking moment, or both.  But she'll get better!  Just do the Lovaas program every waking moment for a year!  Just put her on Super NuThera, and DMG and melatonin... and inositol.  Just find an opthalmologist who prescribes Irlen lenses!  Just get AIT!  Just spend $4,000 on neurobiofeedback!  Just do the SonRise program!  Just find a doctor who'll prescribe Secretin... or Ritalin... or Risperdal.  Do a rotation diet*.  Learn to cook without any wheat or dairy products.  Just do this for a few months, or a few years, and she'll be fine.  Then you'll have time for your other child.And maybe that happened for other kids.  But it never happened for Laurel.  And all Janet's ever known is "just wait. . .just wait. . .just wait. . . ."##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
