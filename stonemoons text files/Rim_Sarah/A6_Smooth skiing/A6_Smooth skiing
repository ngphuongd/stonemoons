She rocks slowly back and forth in the middle of the kitchen and thoughtfully bites her arm in neat rows from the hand up to the elbow. I won't even talk about what we have to do to calm her down.By the time I got to the school last Monday and turned in Janet's sign-up sheet, I was told that the ski bus was full and her name would be put on a waiting list. I was upset (and if you know my default emotional setting, that looks a lot like "angry") for days about how Laurel's problems were causing Janet to miss out on the enriching things other children get to experience.We live only 8 doors down from the school, so I went ahead and got Janet a ski mask and new gloves (she claimed she couldn't hold onto poles with her mittens) and rented skis and boots. I figured we'd go ahead and show up and hope they had a no-show. We got up at 6 this a.m. and headed up to the school. Janet checked in with the ski bus coordinator and said she was on a waiting list. The ski lady said, "No you're not. We have plenty of spaces left. You're on the list." After a moment she said, "I probably should have called you."To my credit, I refrained from saying, "Duh!"##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
