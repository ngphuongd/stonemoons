My sister Kelly would be happy to take Janet for the summer, maybe even for next year.  This would ensure that Janet doesn't get hurt in the cross fire, and that she can do normal things*.  Janet flatly refused.  "I can't live without you, Mom" she said, crossing her arms and frowning back into her pillows.I asked her why."I can't sleep without a hug at night from you.  I need your protection."  Janet wriggled around until she could lay her head in my lap and look up at me.I asked her from what. She thought about it for a while, her eyes closed.  "From everything.  From mean Mrs. McDougal down the street.  From the ghost trees in the park.  From the moon."I held her close.  Looks like we aren't going anywhere, folks.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
