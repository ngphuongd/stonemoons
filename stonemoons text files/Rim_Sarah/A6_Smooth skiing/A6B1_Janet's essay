Then she gets upset.  These are things I don't know about sometimes like going through the door first when we get home from something.  I don’t even know she’s going to get mad, but she starts chasing me and trying to hit me.  She starts crying and yelling.  She seems really frustrated.  Sometimes she claws me.One of the worst things about having an autistic sister is that sometimes, when they’re really mad, they’ll start going nuts and clawing and pinching and pulling hair and hitting.  And kicking.  When she claws me, the way it feels to my mind is like kissing a cat and a dog at the same time ~ while they’re both growling.  It’s yucky and scary.  You think the animals are going to get in a fight.  So you’re scared.  When she claws me, I usually try to break away.  I either run or I hit her because I am afraid.  Later I say I am sorry I hit you. Laurel doesn't say anything cuz she can't talk*.  It’s humiliating when Laurel gets mad in public.  Sometimes at the store, it’s especially humiliating cuz we know a lot of the people there.  There have been times when I felt very proud of myself because, when Mom had to deal with my sister at the grocery store, I got to take over the paying and getting the stuff on the list.  I felt so old and responsible— not like forty years old, but like a big kid.  (Even if I was already seven.  Seven is big, too.  )  A lot of the time, I feel sorry for her because she can’t talk; she can’t get her message across and so she gets frustrated cuz people don’t know what she wants.Sometimes kids say, “At least I’m better than your retarded sister!”  I try to say, “She’s not retarded!”But they say, “She can’t talk and she’s dumb.  That’s retarded.”There’s one thing they don’t know that she does.  When they say that, they’re actually saying she can’t talk, twice, cuz dumb means “can’t talk”.   Sometimes I’m sorrier for them than for Laurel, cuz they don’t know what they’re saying!Laurel isn’t mean. She’s very sweet . She blows bubbles at me in the bathtub and we laugh. Whenever I really need attention*, my mom is there.  It’s just that Laurel needs it more often than I do.  I pretty much accept that, but sometimes it’s very difficult.One of the best things about having an autistic sister— it’s also a bad thing, too—is when you have friends over, they have an excellent time with her, and that feels good because you want your friends to have a good time, but it’s bad because you invited your friends over to be with you and it feels a little bit like they’re ignoring you.The other day, my best friend Carina came over and she and Laurel were running around, playing chase, and they were having a great time.  I ended up playing video games for about half the visit cuz Carina was too busy  playing with Laurel.Sometimes, when I’m on the phone, Laurel starts playing with an extension and pressing the buttons. It’s really annoying, cuz my friends think it’s me, and hang up.  I haven’t lost a friend over it yet. Sometimes I have to call my friends back, and I pick up, but he’s playing with it, and I think someone’susing the phone, and my friends get mad again.Sometimes, when we’re at the pool, Laurel really scares me by pushing Mom underwater, then not letting her up. I’m afraid she’ll drown. Once she even dunked me! I was so afraid, I almost hit her!##Higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
