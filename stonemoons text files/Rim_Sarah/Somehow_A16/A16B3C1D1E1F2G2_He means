And so I think of you.""I need something to say to spackle over the conversation gaps and this is as good as anything.""Perfect eyes, teeth, skin. You just need breast augmentation and I know the guy who can do that.""Your apartment is so clean all the time.  You would make me a perfect housewife.""If this works with you today, I'll try it on Trudy tomorrow.""I just want to have sex with you because you are available and then I can stop thinking about it and go back to the books."This is probably a multiple choice quiz. These, you think, all probably echo his thoughts. But you are never sure about his thinking pattern. You don't want to be. You have always been quicker, always a little surprised he hasn't read the latest, or thought seriously about the crazy things that are always fleeing through your mind. Then again, you don't really know of anyone else who would think about these things. The only person you ever told was that guy in tenth grade, who you showed your journals and thought cities and confessed you dreamed entire coherent movies every night, told you that you scared him. And dropped out of your Algebra 3 class just to stay away from you.So now you hold the hand in front of you and don't bother filling in the quiz blanks.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
