Every night when you come home from work, you cook for him, plan for him.  Scrub the plastic runners on the carpet before he comes in the door.  You plant flowers and spring bulbs—the baby will be here next year, you think, to see them.You plan a nursery. He asks only that his room be kept quiet.  For studying.  You understand. And make the basement over into a child's paradise.You paint*  the walls silver before you know if it will be a girl or a boy.  You want the child's first vision to be as wide as possible. So you paint the ceiling the pale blue of a winter twilight.  Hang moonbeam mobiles over the crib your neighbor gives you.  Paint tiny slivers of moons on each newel post.  Kelly comes over to paint the cow jumping over the moon just where the  baby will see it beyond the bars of the crib.  On Saturday afternoons, you go to thrift shops to find baby clothes and bottles, toys and bibs.  You scour the Salvation Army and Goodwill*, looking for what you don't have.I* want Laurel to know these things.  I want her to know how she felt in my body as she breathed under my belly.  I want her to know she was loved.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
