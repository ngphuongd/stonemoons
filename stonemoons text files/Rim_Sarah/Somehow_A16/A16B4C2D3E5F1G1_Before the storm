He said nothing about the child, so I guess this was only fair.  He came home late, undoing the deadbolt on his study door, slipping inside, turning the light and hot pot on.   He left early, leaving pots of cold coffee and dishes in the sink.I went back to work, leaving Laurel at the Wee Care daycare next to my office building.  Laurel never looked up as I went away, never followed me with her eyes or called after me as she was left in the hands of the teenage, flat faced girl who nodded and held her exactly right.We went on in peace.  The air deadened around us.#higher#lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
