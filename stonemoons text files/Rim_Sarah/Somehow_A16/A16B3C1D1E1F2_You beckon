Settle for the green one with white flecks, the neck just a bit too high, the waist too low. But that is the fashion just now. A simple gold necklace. No. The pearl one you got from your mother for graduating. The pearls with the ersatz gold figurine—the dali-like one. You switch back to the necklace.  You add the faux mother-of-pearl shell you got from Bob last year.  You think of Venus rising and giggle.This is what I always wear, you think. There won't be anything different *. You shrug, wishing for the coral necklace your roommate had and lost the first year of college. This is who you have become.You meet him at the Almond Cafe on the corner of Washington and Colfax. You pretend to get there right out of work, breathless and still full of the proper business decorum and make up.He saves a table by the window. The evening sun shines in white shafts over his high cheekbones. Your fingers can almost feel the short, sharp fuzz underneath.  Your breasts ache in your new lace scalloped bra.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
