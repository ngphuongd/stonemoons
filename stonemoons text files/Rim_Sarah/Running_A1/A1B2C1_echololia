NOTE:Echololia is a repeating sound.  The child might say something she heard before in that spot or in another location.  For example, if a teacher said "Let's go for a walk"  three months ago and then proceeded to get a drink of water, the child might say "Let's go for a walk" when she really wants a drink of water.Needless to say, this repetition creates more of a mystery than it solves.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
