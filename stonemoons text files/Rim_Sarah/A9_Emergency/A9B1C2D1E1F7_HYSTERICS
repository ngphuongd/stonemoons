Hysterics. Hysteria. n. psychological state or neurosis resulting from failure to face reality.A released womb wandering in a woman's body, causing uncontrollable behavior.Just as we guardians of the womb must be mad simply from the aching cavern within us, so too the moon must be mad simply from the aching loneliness of her empty womb.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
