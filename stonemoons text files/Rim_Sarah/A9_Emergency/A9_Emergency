Given the way Laurel's been acting, I was pretty much expecting it. The school secretary said that Laurel had hit Carrie, the assistant teacher and Carrie was in the hospital with a broken jaw. It might even be worse, the secretary said. Laurel beat her pretty badly. She said I needed to come pick up Laurel right away. 10 minutes ago if possible. The janitor was looking after her, was being pounded, and didn't know how many more minutes he could hold out.And please make sure that she doesn't come back here. We can't handle the violence any more. So I went up to the school to try to get Laurel. I kept replaying the weird meeting we had last week in my mind. Had Laurel heard about the aversives, the time out room? Did she know we were planning something more to restrict her?Or was she frightened of the idea of all of us leaving for various medical things? Did she care about that? OR maybe it was a piece of paper on the floor that should have been upside down or the oreo she had for lunch had been facing the wrong way. OR whatever. I laughed out loud a bit when I realized that all this speculation wasn't getting me to the school any faster.__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
