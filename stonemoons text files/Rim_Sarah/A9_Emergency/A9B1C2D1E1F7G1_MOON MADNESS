In the old days, they might have called it moonstruck. If she had lived that long. If they hadn't struck her down for being a witch. Luna, the night moth. Lunacy after the moon goddess. In the old days, they would have asked me what it would take to cleanse the moon-madness from my womb. If I were not so tired, I would know the answer. A modern miracle. An easy delete* key on the keyboard, erasing the error as if it had never shown up on our clean white screens.But I am so tired that I believe the moon has not made a mistake.##goback##presson_________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
