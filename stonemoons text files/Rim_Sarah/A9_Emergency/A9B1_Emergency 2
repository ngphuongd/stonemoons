The veins in his arms stood blue against the white smooth ivy skin as he held her tight. Samson's face was a cold mask. He tried to speak, and just sputtered for a minute. Then he stood up slowly and started, "I've been a punching bag." He walked out of the room stiffly, looking back at us at all times. "I'll..."  But that was all he said.I have no profound closing comment. I needed to tell someone. If someone out there has answers, or questions, or sympathy, or even criticism, I'll take it gratefully. (Not quite as gratefully on the criticism.)##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
