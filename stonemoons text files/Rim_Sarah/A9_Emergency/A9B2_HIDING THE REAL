To:   Sarah MurphyFrom:   SarahSubject:   Truth filesThe moon kept trying every trick she knew—or didn't know—to put the words back into life. Failing that, she tried to take the substance from the words and give it to the shadowy things that still miserably existed, dragging their shells, looking for the missing wholes.Nothing worked. Soon the very words of her blood and pages of her skin were in danger of disintegrating from her spells. The people kept coming to her, begging her to restore whatever it was they had lost. Or to tell them again what they had lost so that they could begin long, arduous quests for it themselves.Until finally, she had had enough. The moon exploded into two:   a brighter version of herself (which stole the light from a hundred sacrificed* stars) and a paler shadow to catch the leftover brilliance."This is what you meant," she cried out to her people. "You missed the light. That is all. Now go and live in peace. Forget what you do not have. Concentrate on what is there ~ for those are the only things that exist now."But the moon knew this was not so.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
