We had Laurel's first IEP (Individualized Education Plan) meeting of the year. Nope, they haven't actually hired the teachers, yet, but they are playing telephone tag as we speak. Nope, they don't actually have a room yet, but we may be able to convert one of the storage closets on the lower level. I asked them for something better. They said they'd try. I'm gonna look into a trailer and a space heater. Not that anyone should confuse the two.Yet, for the first time in a long time, I came away from an IEP meeting higher than a kite! No, they didn't snort anything there, you silly people with your so-eager-to-corrupt-little-minds. (Although, as a total aside, they really should. .  these meetings are worse than a incompetent phlebotomist digging inside your vein, barely missing your soul, and all the while asking, well, MOM, have you stopped irrevokably harming your child yet?)And then they wonder why we get so annoyed sometimes. Anyway, I am soaring high because they actually crawled out of their tiny comfy mind shells and did something right for once!Anyway, the good news is (And there actualy is a lot of good news—at least as far as I am concerned, thrilling news, and I should probably let you have it without all this build up, but I like the theatrics...)DRUM ROLL PLEASEWe actually convinced them to do facilitated typing. On my rusty old MacClassic. Isn't this incredible? To actually convince a school professional to try something a little new? We must be doing something right in their eyes. I gave them the whole background, carefully explaining the theories behind what Chris and I have been doing this summer. Our nonstop work has paid off in spades. and trowels. and flowers. The comm book is almost, but not quite, the natural order of things. (I will make a comm book for the school so we can both have one—Hooray for consistency!) We've been stimming (repeating Laurel's spinning, or head nodding) along with Laurel just to provide a safe atmosphere. (They will not be doing this as it reinforces negative socializaton behavior patterns. Hooray for inconsistency!)Then we told them about the facilitated typing we started. We have progressed rapidly from "yes" to "I wanna Pepsi" and now onto some truly interesting stuff. Laurel almost says "I wanna" and then types. Then she says "Stop" and ends. Almost always on a period. With incredible grammar. And very few typing errors—usually just hitting a key next to the one she wanted. She will go back and hit the delete key, and retype—she seems to be fastidious about this.I showed the school her latest one today. They were convinced I'd done it. And were wondering about my medication. But Chris swore on a stack of Bibles* that this really did work. We showed the old ones to demonstrate Laurel's typing progress. They said no one could learn that fast. So I said, "OK. Why don't we do the exercise just because it is something she likes to do and one of the few things she'll sit still for for 20 minutes at a time? We can call it a reading readiness exercise or something."  They said, ok*. Hooray for peace and quiet! So they wrote up their own rationale. Which is just fine with me. Hey, whatever works, works.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
