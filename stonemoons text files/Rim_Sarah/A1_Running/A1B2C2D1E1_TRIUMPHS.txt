I do not remember when I first realized this was a fight to the death.  I think perhaps I have known this from the moment of my own conception.  Yet I do not tell Laurel this.I tell her I am not ready for the moon to have her.  I tell her she is safe with me.My fingers press against her flesh as we struggle, as I hold  Laurel back from the moon.  My fingers cause pools of blood to gather under her pale skin.  And we both know the sacrifices demanded to keep her here.I tell her I have the strength to hold her and I clutch at her chest, holding her tightly against me.  Sometimes she clutches back. Sometimes she wanders away, her eyes caught in the moonlight.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
