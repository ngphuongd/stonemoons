The kids and I slept late, but instead of going straight to the sugar cereals and videos, both Janet and Laurel got dressed and went outside to play in the brisk, calm air. Janet kept running in with this new blade of grass, a possible sighting of a robin, and reports of crocuses in Mrs. Cooper's yard.Things looked great. I had a few moments to me and I was planning my spending spree of time. I was going to take a long shower, watch "Roseanne", read some Piers Anthony, play a coupla games with the babies. But first I went to check on Laurel. She was on the roof. Her hands were artistically splayed above her head, her feet in a classic ballarina's pose (the fifth position, I think).  And she was leaning way too far to the other side.   You know how in those moments everything is supposed to go in slow motion?  Well, it didn't.Laurel took a flying leap, chortled, and jumped   off the other side of the house.  I made record time getting to her, throwing old tricycles, pop cans, half a lawnmower, and other urban detritus out of the way.  She was sitting quite still, stunned, with her arms wrapped around her chest, which was unusual for her.  She let me kneel by her side and help her to her feet, but she couldn't put any weight on her left foot. She had that peculiar, jagged breathing that makes me think of broken bones. Dad sped over to sit on Janet. Chris shoved her husband, Rob out the door to help me take Laurel to the Emergency Room. I suggested we take two cars, but Rob said there was no chance he was leaving until the last paper was signed, so we just took mine. Laurel adapted beautifully to maneuvering herself from the car to a wheelchair.  She didn't want to lie down, didn't trust that big machine that the radiology tech said, "won't hurt." But with the help of a little tylenol and codeine, and an inflated surgical glove, she decided she could hang out for a little while. The x-rays didn't show any breaks, but the ER doc said that kids' breaks often don't show, especially not within the first hours after the injury. Nonetheless, ER doc said that the degree of pain Laurel is showing indicates a probable break. The nurse announced she was going to put a splint on Laurel's foot. Laurel shook her head "no" so hard her hair whapped her chin. I explained that this probably wasn't the best idea, as if Laurel didn't want it, she certainly would have it off in about two nanoseconds flat.The nurse muttered under her breath that she could certainly understand that, but asked if we could just keep an eye on Laurel so she wouldn't tear the cast off.  After all, it would only be for about three weeks.  Chris, Rob, and I started laughing hysterically. It had taken all three of us to keep an eye on her in the emergency room   how did the nurse think we were going to do it after we got her home??? After we calmed down a bit, the ER doc said that if she didn't have at least a splint, then the bone would not heal properly and we would probaly have to rebreak it and reset it. I asked if we could create some sort of bandage that would keep the bones together and still be impossible for a very active, highly adept seven-year-old to take off. The doc, bless his heart, came up with a steel cage-like thing that he locked around Laurel's shin and ankle. Then he put the plaster on top of that. There was no way that she could get her hands under the plaster and steel. So this worked out well. We applauded. He bowed.Laurel tolerated it 'til we got to the car. Then she started screaming and banging her leg on the front seat. Chris and Rob climbed in back to hold her. Laurel clopped Chris on the chin with the cast   a heavy clomp. We thought we'd have to go back into the emergency room, but Chris announced that she'd survive. After we got home, Laurel needed to "undo" the imbalance of having gone out the back and off the front of the house. On her one good foot, she found it necessary to climb over the fence. Twice. Rob completely disapproved. And helped. I carried Laurel through the back yard and into the house. Then she was fine, and allowed me to carry her to the shower where she could just wet her upper body and good leg, to the kitchen for a bedtime snack, and into her room to bed. I am one pooped puppy. I'm going to look into borrowing a wheelchair for her. But right now, I'm going to bed. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
