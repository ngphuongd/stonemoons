While I was typing, Laurel had gotten out of her room and was decorating the hallway in a tasteful shade of peanut butter and broken glass.   This would have been ok, except that the floor had to be decorated to match, and she was barefoot.  We got the glass out of her foot and she insisted on putting the bloody glass onto the wall—where it belonged.  I will wait until she falls asleep to clean up the mess.So, needless to say, Laurel is still very much alive.  The gas station attendant on Monaco knows us pretty well.  Luckily, Laurel was in his line of sight (about 50 feet away).  He saw what was going on, left his store, and ran out to grab Laurel.Laurel bit him.  He held on and grasped her shoulders.  Laurel struggled.  He pulled her up off the sidewalk and dragged her into the gas station.  Not daring to let go because he feared my darling daughter would bite again, he yelled at a customer to call 911.  The customer, a big burly guy about 6 feet 6 or so grabbed Laurel's legs, which were kicking faster than a helicopter's propellers and doing just about as much damage to the gas station attendant's snow-caked legs.    Another customer, a small black-haired lady, saw only a small portion of what was going on, drew her own conclusions, and called 911 to report a burglary in progress.  In the meantime, I was still on the ground about 100 yards away from the gas station, trying to get up.  My hip was simply not cooperating and was perusing travel brochures for the Caribbean or maybe even Tahiti.So I started to crawl toward the gas station, calling out that Laurel was autistic and was not going to hurt anyone.  I could not see what was going on.The cops came when I was about on the 60 yard line and crawling for the tackle.  I was still sliding on the snow, and snow had come in through various convenient portions of my jeans and was melting/freezing other unmentionable parts of my anatomy.  I called out as the cop entered the store, but he was much too interested in the burglary.  I don't know what was said in there, but I can imagine, as the cop was out in about a minute, scouring the street for me.  I called out again and he came over.  He said not to move, and he called the paramedics. I told him my daughter was autistic, and could not speak or reason (which is a bit of a lie, but under the circumstances was the easiest thing to say).  He said that everything was under control there and not to worry.I kept crawling forward anyway.He sighed and said, "Well, if that's the way you want it, lady." and gave me a hand up.  We covered the last 50 yards and when I got into the store, I could see Laurel was calming down.  So I said that I could hold her and took over from the burly customer.  Laurel immediately wriggled out of my grasp, grabbed a Pepsi from the display, and started chugging it.  At that point, I found I had forgotten my wallet. The gas station attendant said, "Don't worry about it, lady.  I'll catch you next time." I tried to tell him how grateful I was and he just said, "Merry Christmas, ma'am."The paramedics checked out my hip, pronounced it merely bruised, and left without a bill when they figured out what was going on.  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
