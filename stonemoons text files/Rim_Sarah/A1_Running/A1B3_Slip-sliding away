While I was washing dishes, she planned her escape.  The child has been watching David Copperfield, or maybe old movies of Houdini (I don't know, did they really make old movies of Houdini?).  She must be emulating someone, surely this couldn't come out of one innocent child's own head!  She left the water running in ythe sink, and the noise hid the slight noises as she dragged the chair to the door, clambered up, and de-activated the alarm Rob installed for me just last week.   Mission accomplished, she slipped out the door, left the house barefoot and ran out into the ice and snow, making a bee-line for the grocery store and Colorado Boulevard . I noticed a green flash outside the window and instictively ran to the door.  This day, my self-preservation genes were kicking in—I stopped to get shoes. By the time I looked up (5 nanoseconds later, I am really getting to be a fast-change artist), she was nowhere to be seen.  So I ran out to the car, which wouldn't start, natch.   No one else was around (it was about noon-thirty, and Janet had gone off with the Coopers for a day trip to Keystone—the Coopers paid for her day skiing and sledding as a Christmas present—but I digress). So I ran after the footprints in the snow (we'd gotten about 4 inches the day before this).  I saw her green dress in the snow just this side of Colorado Boulevard, and ran like hell to get to her.  But I slipped on the ice and skidded. Pain surrounded me with its sudden, final dictatorship.  I could not get up off the ground.  I could not move. I could only watch with horror as she sat down and slid into the busy road.  I knew no one would see her.  I knew this was the end.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
