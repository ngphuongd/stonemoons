Listen. Please just listen.  How can sparing one small soul, one tiny child even matter to you~ you who have created the universe?  It matters so much to me, and can mean so little to you.  Let me have my child.  Leave us trifles alone.Listen. Just for once, listen.  I'm begging the mother in you who is the mother in me who cannot stop wanting her child.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
