To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Heart filesYou have to run after your child and you cannot run.You have to lift her up and you cannot lift her up.You have to find the money to feed here and there is no money.In one horrible, lung-fire-filled instant, every idea I had about keeping her safe for her whole life vanished from every known universe.__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
