It doesn't really matter that you are all so far away from me, and that the only lines of communication we have are these little plastic boxes and silver lines.  I have felt and appreciated and sent virtual hugs to each one of you... and I do so need your hugs now.  Now that it is all over of course. Let me begin at the beginning of this sordid little tale.  Laurel and some other kids go swimming every Tuesday at the Y. She loves the water, and I love just watching her little yellow cap bobbing up and down through the chlorine green.   This is the one and only time she will stand for anything on her head—I think she follows the electorial philosophy of suffering the lesser evil—a thick plastic cap or water in her ears and eyes.   Her rituals are worthy of a choir spot on Ethel Merman's shows, supposing the lines of time and space could be warped enough to bring that about.  Laurel swims in a four foot circle in the shallow part, her head barely below the water, her arms holding her knees as she kicks silently. When the water sprays, she stops circling and stands for a moment, letting the water just lap into the kelly green top of her one piece.The other kids form rings around the rosy, stick their feet up through the air in the shallow part, and hunt monsters down as long as their breath holds them together. Laurel ignores them entirely.  She is much more interested in her own little pockets of posy, her poses and pirouettes.Anyway, I really am getting to my point, because I always have at least one.  Anyway again, last Tuesday Laurel must have gotten tired of swimming and got out of the pool early. I hadn't looked at her for about 3 or 4 minutes, and she was just gone. This was deeply scary. I took a breath and ran into the ladies room. No Laurel. Went into the men's room. No Laurel. Lots of strange looks, and even one wolf whistle, but no Laurel.Then I ran out barefoot in 30-degree weather trying to catch her. I ran forever, and finally my lungs filled with fire and air refused to move through me. Then I saw Laurel—only a block and a half away, the yellow bathing cap jumping up and down like the little jump stick dolls they used to have when everybody who is older than the hills grew up. (which just dates me, but anyway I'm getting to the scary part here, so just hold your breath folks).This is the scary part:   My side cramped so badly I could not move. And no one would help me.__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
