Laurel has been using a rental wheelchair for the past five days.  I managed to get her one the morning after she jumped off the roof. The cast is still on, but she doesn't seem to feel the pain when she walks.  So she has walked a bit, been surprised when her leg does not work, sat a bit, forgot about it, and walked a bit more.  To combat this, I went down to the Crypt* to get some restraints and tie her into the chair. Unfortunately, I got only the buckle kind, not the lock and key kind.Today, as I was working on a business letter, not ten feet from where I'd tied Laurel to the chair, I realized I hadn't heard from her for about ten minutes.  I looked at her chair.  Nothing there.  I pulled my heart down from the ceiling and  went outside—merely to find the little bugger climbing back onto the roof!  Expletive deleted! I rushed up onto the roof before realizing that I am terrified of heights. The rolling in the stomach. The pressing behind the eyes as you realize two totally separate, simultaneous states of reality:       1. It is high up here.     2. There is no phone on the roof.I choked back my screams and started toward Laurel, crooning in my most comforting voice, "peanut, peanut butter, peanut peanut butter," over and over again. This helped some. At least, I felt calmer. Laurel stayed just a few inches away from me during all of this, slowly and steadiy climbing higher on the tarry, grey-and-red pebbled shingles. Her cast made scratchy noises, light scraping against my nerves. The sandpaper roughness was just enough to catch the edges of my fear. Laurel, of course, felt none of this. Finally she reached the apex of the roof and straddled it like a horse. Then she patted the roof and said "Gee go," which is what I say when I let her on the penny-a-ride horse in the front of the Super KMart.  I wasn't sure if the echololia* was good right here or not.  In any other circumstances, I would have been wallowing ecstatically in the sound of Laurel's voice.  The vertigo in my stomach kept my mind on the current matter.I didn't dare get any closer, as Laurel was only two feet from the edge of the roof. She looked back at me and giggled. I shouted for Janet and bless her, she came running in from playing with her friend Carina about two doors up.  Carina ran to get her father, Mr. Fisher.  Mr. Fisher came over in his bare feet and terry cloth robe.  That is the great thing about my neighbors, they know that when I call, it really IS an emergency.Laurel and I sat up there for about fifteen minutes while Mr. Fisher, on my instructions, set up the ladder. Janet climbed up (I didn't want to risk anyone who wasn't a family member), and set out a trail of orange Starburst candies—one for every two shingles on the shortest way down to the ladder. Hey, don't knock bribery. It worked!  Laurel was mostly crawling once she got back inside, but the cast seemed to hold up pretty well.  With that steel lining, it should hold up against practically anything—up to and including a nuclear disaster. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
