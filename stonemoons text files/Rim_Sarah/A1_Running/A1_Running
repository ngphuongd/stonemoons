She has figured out the doorbell alarm system and can deactivate it in I think about 4 seconds flat. So anyway, she ran out without a stitch of clothing on and started to jump up and down in the middle of the street.I left Janet watching the Muppets, told her to stay in the house no matter what, and ran out after Laurel in my bare feet. I cut myself on some glass Laurel had thrown down from her window last night, so I left bloody foot prints in the snow trying to catch her.Laurel was too far away, and I ran back into the house for shoes and the car keys. I didn't even try to breathe as I sprinted to the car. I drove with the door open, yelling the theme from the "peanut, peanut butter" commercial she loves so much. Sure enough, three blocks later, I caught up with her, just before she ran into the Highline canal.  In a moment of inspiration, I called out "Dorito Time!"  Laurel ran into the car and buckled up right away.Mrs. Macdougal called me a serial child abuser again and threatened to call Social Services. I was too busy making sure Laurel was ok to answer.When we got back, Laurel made a bee-line for the snow, just avoiding the shattered glass underneath her window. She mashed it up into her face, smearing the leftover smudges of blood across her cheek and into her hair.Then she came up and put her sticky hand in mine, pulling for the refrigerator. So we went and had 7-Up and Pepsi.My feet are ok now, just a little scratched. I am soaking them in hydrogen peroxide while I type. Laurel is curled up behind the couch and has her hand over her nose, shielding her eyes like a cat. I blow kisses at her. She does not notice.--> Continue   #delve deeper  ___________________Sarah / Moon / Laurel___________________
