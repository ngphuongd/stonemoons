Laurel's clothes. You know how difficult it is to get Laurel to wear anything, and I cheered and hurrahed and champagne-celebrated (without the champagne, of course) when she finally decided she actually would wear clothes. And so she will now keep her clothes on just as long as they are bright lemon yellow and kelly green and made from 100 percent cotton or silk (she does have taste, my child). Even her underwear has to be yellow or green. Usually I can persuade her to wear both yellow socks or both green socks but she can be stubborn about that, too. So finding clothes is extremely difficult, but luckily I have such great friends who are willing to fire up their idle sewing machines. Thank you one and all.Anyway, I didn't really just want to tell you about the clothes but about what they mean to others. My mother flew in from California for the holiday and brought with her a veritable palace of great clothes from Rodeo Drive etc. Janet was in seventh heaven as she tried on practically everything and begged her grandmother to fix her hair differently for each outfit. And then came Laurel. And you got it. Not a yellow and green outfit in the bunch. We are talking high fashion here, and apparently yellow and green did not make the list of top ten colors for the year. Maybe next year, but not this one. And for fashion, apparently, this is the only year that counts.So at any rate, my mother  threw the fit. She couldn't believe that Laurel was so selfish not to want any of these great clothes, that surely even an imbecile could understand high fashion and what it meant.I asked my mother, very politely, to leave.  There were no chain saws involved.  Not even the barest hint of a threat of metal and/or any other substance indicating bodily harm.She said she'd be happy to leave this broken down nuthouse.And so she did.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
