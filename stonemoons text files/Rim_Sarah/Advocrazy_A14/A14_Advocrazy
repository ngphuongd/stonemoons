So she ran and got me a hammer. Cute kid. Y'all want the bad news, right? I can see you hovering on the edges of your monitor. You don't fool me. Well, Ms. Springer, the advocate from Association for Community Living, was fifteen minutes late. She ran into the room, and we (rather, Mr. Maddox, the school principal, did—he wouldn't let anyone else speak — and he spoke only to the advocate, as if my presence were superfluous) filled her in on the three surgeries, two cancers, and one behavior problem. He joked that Laurel must be carcinogenic. We stared at him. Ms. Scratchard filled her in on the lovely residential home. What they did not explain was the catch 22—if I refused to surrender my child, they would say I was refusing all services and then refuse to help Laurel either this school year or next.She said, and I hereby commit her words to quotes, "Well, it looks as if you don't have any choice at the moment. I assume the school will be paying for all expenses, which fulfills your responsibilities."Then she turned to me, patted my hand, and said, "Well, after all dear, we can always review this situation later."And before I could sputter out that the whole problem was the school was trying to deny me a voice in future reviews, that this was permanent and meant giving up my custody rights, she was gone!! Whatever I said after that didn't matter. The decision was made, and mom was simply relegated to having hysterics.##delve deeper ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
