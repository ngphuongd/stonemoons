NOTE:It is my hair that makes me the most selfish.  I can go days without a shower if I cannot spare the few seconds from watching Laurel. But  after a while, the lank, limp grease strands running down my back tell me I am less than human.  And I wash my hair.This is when I get into trouble.##back __________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
