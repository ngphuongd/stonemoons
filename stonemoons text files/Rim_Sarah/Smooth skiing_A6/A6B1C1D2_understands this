NOTE:I was snuggling with Janet on the loving room couch and asked her what she felt when I had to spend so much time with Laurel.  Was she mad?  "I dunno," she said.  We snuggled more in silence.  I picked up Little Women and started to read the part where the Alcott sisters give up their Christmas breakfast for the Hummels.Janet put her arm on my hand, preventing me from turning the page."No, I can't be mad. Laurel's sick and she needs you.  If I were that ill, would you still love me, too?"  Her eyes grew big and she turned her head up to me."Janet, I will love you and Laurel no matter what happens." I vowed."Good then." she said.And we kept on reading.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
