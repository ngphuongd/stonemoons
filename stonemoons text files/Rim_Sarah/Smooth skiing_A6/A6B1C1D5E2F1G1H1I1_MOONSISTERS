Once at three in the morning, I woke to the sound of distant thumping.  I crawled out of bed.  Janet and Laurel were jumping up and down on Laurel's bed in the moonlight, their skins shining an alabaster pale in the darkness.I asked Janet what game they were playing.Moonsisters, she replied.Monsters like Dracula, werewolves, or yeerks I asked, hoping I had misheard her.No. Moon sisters.  Laurel is from the Moon and I am her sister, so we are moonsisters.  Moonsisters eat jelly sandwiches and smear jelly all over their chins so they can taste the blood in the earth.  Moonsisters hide under the curtains so they can jump out and take you when you least expect it.  Moonsisters never let each other go.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
