It had been an aggressive day for Laurel, so we were just taking it easy and mellow, walking around slow. I walked Laurel into the playground as I was just a bit early and we both waited for her class to come out.  As Laurel had the playground all to herself, she went up the slide and back down, up the swings and back down, on the see-saw and back down, in a regular, monotonous circuit.  Each step was precisely the same length, each action precisely the same—a playground ritual.The kids came streaming out of the double doors and Laurel got frightened.  So she quickly completed her last circuit and came over to me, trembling.  She started to flap her arms and hum loudly, tapping her forehead into my upper thigh.Janet and a few girls from her class walked over to us.  "Who is that?" a girl asked, twirling a strand of her peach and grape colored hair. "That is my sister, Laurel" Janet said, her arm on Laurel's possessively."What's wrong with  her?" was the next query.  Janet launched into the whole spiel:  "There is nothing wrong with her.  She just has autism.  Autism is when someone takes out your brain, puts it in a blender and tries to put it back in and connect everything up, but gets it all wrong."  I couldn't have said it better myself.  The girls said, ok and wanted to know if Laurel had any of the latest Power Rangers or Pogs and if so would she share them.I said no, but offered to bring in cookies.  This was acceptable to all concerned.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
