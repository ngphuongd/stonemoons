The moon never shows the same face twice.  She gathers the clouds into veils, concealing her intentions.Or she hangs high after the sun has risen, never relinquishing her place, never content to remain in the bright shadows of the sun.But I know her.  In all of her disguises, I know her.And I will brave more than  Colorado Boulevard in rush hour, more than the OCR, more than the Social Services themselves to ensure that the moon does not conceal my child as she does her face.##moon##sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
