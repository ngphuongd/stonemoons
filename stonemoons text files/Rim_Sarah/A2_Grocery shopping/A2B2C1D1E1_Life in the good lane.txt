(This is sort of like the way the Japanese treat fortunes at their temples—if you get a good one, you leave it at the temple so the gods remember, and if you get a bad one, you leave it at the temple so the gods forget. )  So forgive me for not writing when there is good stuff happening—and when there is bad stuff.But right now, there is only good.   Laurel can communicate.  She knows what she wants.  I can see the person inside, like the first tips of pale yellow color swelling from a tight furry green rosebud.This evening, Laurel decided to take a walk. She dumped all of the icons out for her comm book and frenetically searched through them. Finally selecting the slide, Pepsi, book, tree, and starburst icons, she slathered the whole mess on the this is what is about to happen page in her comm book. Then she gathered up the book and walked out the door with it, cradling it in her arms.  She didn't let me see the book of course, but as I was hovering just in front of her, I could see what was going on.I darted back into the house a half dozen times, getting money, Kodi's collar and leash, my shoes!  And Laurel waited out front, amidst but not with a bunch of neighborhood kids.  We walked up to the school and she tried to get in. Alas, it was locked up tight. She pointed to the book icon on her comm book and then the school. Yes! COMMUNICATION!!!! NO! I don't have the KEY!!!Communication does not quite yet grasp Sundays in summer. Luckily, on one of my half dozen trips back to the house, I'd picked up Jane Eyre, and Laurel was content to take the book over to the merry go round in the playground. She lay face up, holding the book like a fashionable fan and flipping the pages—upside down.So we played on the playground. Every time I glanced at Laurel, Janet urgently needed me to watch her.  Janet did cartwheels, loop-the-loops, and summersalts*.  So Laurel pretty much wandered about and did whatever without supervision. When the sun was kissing the mountains, we made our calm egress through the dust-pink light. Anyway, I just had to tell you guys. I am still so thrilled! I want to just grab this feeling and part it and lock it up in the refrigerator like the friends sourdough starter. And have it forever. I cannot keep my hands on the keyboard! Good night. Really, really good night.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
