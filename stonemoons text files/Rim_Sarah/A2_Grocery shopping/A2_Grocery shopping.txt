Laurel was fine until we got to the checkout line, thanks in part to a trick I learned from her teachers; I took one of her shoes. She won't run away unless she has both her shoes on. Mostly.At the checkout line, I guess Laurel felt we had missed something, because she leapt out of the cart and tried to run off. When I restrained her, she began screaming and biting me. She got angrier, going for more painful targets, biting and headbutting and kicking. Janet took over the business arrangements; paid using my debit card, and walked the bagger out to the car, where she waited for me. ( I tell you that kid is smart for 7. I wasn't counting cents off coupons when I was her age.)Meanwhile, Laurel was on the floor, her arms and face smeared with blood mine. I was literally drippping blood on the floor. Two ladies, bless 'em, asked if they could help. One told me she was a nurse and said I was doing an excellent job. I tell you, I would never recognize them in a police line up. It is amazing how one doesn't even see the person one is speaking to when engaged so completely with a freaking child.   Does the universe contract with me to that one focal point or does the universe notice my  focus, shrug, and go on without me?In the car, Laurel pounded my shoulder, gouged my arm, and yanked out handfuls of my hair as we drove home. Anyway, I just thought I'd tell you about all this so that you know. TOS*, if you read about my murder/suicide, you are to inform the press that Ms. Eleanor Bradshaw, assistant director of special education for Cattail Creek School District e-mail address ebradshaw@cattailelem.co.edu, is responsible. Despite the laws, and for all she gets paid out of your tax dollars, she has yet to find a placement or behavioral intervention or respite person in six and a half months of looking. Laurel has not had an actual school day since last December when I yanked her out of the closet they had her in. They have been trying for something ever since. And god only knows what will happen this year.  We have no summer program (as promised to make up for the lack of a winter program). Let alone what will happen next school year. AAAACK.I'll tell you guys more tomorrow.##delve deeper  ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
