Sort of like the IRS tax forms:                    Line A. How much money did you make last year?  _________                    Line B:  Write a check for Line A and send it in.Anyway, this morning, Janet and I discussed all the work that needs to be done to keep the household working smoothly.  (More of a forced discussion, actually.  If I could have tied her to the chair wihout getting it from the SS, I would have.) I've informed her that these are not things she gets paid for; she gets money for the things she needs. She cleans her room and looks after her things because she is a person. She helps with the laundry and the dishes because she's a member of this family. She will do what she needs to do to be a member of her school and community.  Ahh the lectures in this household. We sat down and figured out what her expenses are:  if she were to put one third of her income into savings and donate ten percent to a worthy, charitable organization, and pay for her own goodies and outings, and presents for friends and family, and half of any special classes she wants to take, like karate or dance or drama, and her miscellaneous needs such as hair accessories, bike locks and what not   that works out to about $20 per week! I've told her also that I will buy her clothes, but if she paints or cuts or otherwise ruins them, she must pay to replace them. Also, I'll pay for toothbrushes and toothpaste and routine dental attention, but _she_ pays for cavities. She asked me, "Does this mean Laurel pays for stuff?"  I said, well, "Laurel isn't ready to understand the real world yet, so we have to be a bit patient."Janet said, "I like Laurel's world better."Ya know, I almost had to agree!  Laurel is treating the comm book like a normal part of everyday life.  She got it out and we went to the store again.  I tried to go past the convenience store, but Laurel wanted to go in. She selected a Pepsi, some Doritos, and some LifeSavers gummies, and almost walked out the door with them. I signaled to the clerk, who quickly got out of his bulletproof case and stood at the door. (Thank whatever deity is currently in vogue that the store was empty and he could do that!) So Laurel stopped, staring at brightly colored package in her hand and the imposing denim blocking the door. She turned around and handed the clerk her wallet.This, I must say is vocational progress. But she spent a total of $5.06 there today. Another hefty allowance, and she is not doing her own saving, presents, classes, etc. Oh me...I'm not sure I can afford Laurel's world.G'night. I'm going to bed. G'night. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
