They promise classes; they give closet space.  They say they plant tomaters, but all I gets is weeds. Aack, sorry. Not doing so well on the accents today.So I'm reading Doug Biklen's and Rosemary Crossley's stuff about facilitated communication and I decide to try it mine own self. Jus' little ol me and let's not bring in the system this year. Chris has generously offered to be my second in command whilst I teach. With the trusty aid of her Singer sewing machine, we put together a communication book for Laurel. The book is made from 2 blocks of 8 by 17 inch dark navy upholstry cloth. We cut out the pages, sewed down the middle, et voila, a book. We then bought out the local supply of velcro strips. We sewed the fuzzy edges in just like lines in a primer, and then cut up the hard plasticy edges into one inch strips. Then we pasted pictures on the one inch strips:  Pepsi, Doritos, starbursts, Applebees, feet, arms, dresses (yellow only), shirts and socks (green only). All the things in Laurel's world.  Of course magazines don't have pictures of zorfs* or shattered glass, or moonbeams, but we made do. Now we have a place in the book for what is coming up, what has happened, what is happening. So the book (and the plastic bag of velcro'd concepts) go with us. We actually got Laurel to take it and velcro for an aggregate total of 15 minutes out of 5 hours trying the first day.Not so bad, eh? When you consider that home schoolers just need to be in educational status for 4 hours a day (the educators themselves figure the rest is lost in administrivia*.) When you subtract out class distractions and get to the individual attention, you probably have about what we got.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
