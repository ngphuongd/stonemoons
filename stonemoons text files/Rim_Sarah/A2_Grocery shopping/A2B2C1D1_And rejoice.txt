I have also bombarded her with Vitamin B, and am doing a regimen of zorfs*.We are working with Laurel, getting her to find a banana and put it on the word "banana," find an orange and put it on the word "orange" (She does amazingly well at this, actually. When she does put an object on the word it is right. The only difficulty comes when she puts the object on the couch or the table, and cannot understand that this does not count in the strange game we play.)  Laurel began to walk away and try the front doors.  Rob just put another complicated switch on it so she can't get out without an alarm going off and she has yet to figure the new one out. Chris gave her the communication/icon book that we've been developing.  Laurel took out the "Safeway" (grocery store) icon and put it on the velcro strip on the first page the area that says "this is what is now going to happen." Bless Chris, she agreed to stay and greet Janet when she came home from day camp at 3 (it was about 2:30) while I jumped in the car to take Laurel to Safeway.  Wandering up and down each aisle and examining the floorboards very carefully, she was extremely quiet.  She chose Doritos and Pepsi and candy, located in widely different areas in the store. Then she strode purposefully up to a lighted counter.  There were a few people ahead of her and she waited in line, holding the Pepsi bottle like a baby and crooning to it.  When the clerk got to us, she gave the bottle to him to see it, and then snatched it back.  Then she rooted through my purse, got my wallet, handed it to the clerk.  The clerk handed me back my wallet; I gave Laurel cash to give to the clerk (reinforcement behaviour).  But Laurel tried to find a slot in the checkstand machinery to put it in.   You can kind of understand her dilemma surely there can't be more than one way to pay at the grocery store.   Everything has to go through the slot and back into her purse.  Except that the clerk wants to keep the money.  We finally got it clear.  What a cutie! We got home and things were fine. Thus today, I was on a cloud. Nah, on a roller coaster of clouds. Screaming up into the soft floating air, flying like nothing was holding me on the ground, dreaming of true weightlessness. I waxed ecstatic to Mrs. Cooper four doors down when she came out to sweep the walk. I rhapsodized over Laurel's appropriate use of her comm book. Not to mention her appropriate use of my arms, legs, etc. I kissed my healing bruises I was so happy.Mrs. Cooper cracked a smile and shook my hand.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
