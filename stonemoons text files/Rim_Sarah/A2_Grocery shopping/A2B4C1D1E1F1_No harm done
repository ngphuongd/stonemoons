I physically kept her from walking out into Colorado Boulevard for about 15 minutes, until Mr. Cooper drove by, recognized the situation, and pulled over. He and I grabbed Laurel by both arms and one foot and shoved her into the car. Then we dragged her into the house, where she pulled my hair, punched and kicked me. I pushed her into her room and locked her in. I owe that couple. Massive major. And I don't even know their first names. But still I am pawing the ground. Snort snort snort, heavy breath, heavy breath, heavy breath (and not all of it from the bone-murdering trauma of keeping Laurel from running into a highway at the thick of rush hour). Mostly, I'm mad about the people who honked and swore at me like I was killing my child—and yet offered not their one little pinky to help me save her.Rationally, I suppose what they all saw out the window was a mean mother grabbing any convenient part of an unruly child's anatomy for some ill-tempered venting. They didn't see the age-old drama of mother putting herself in physical danger to save the life of the child. These are the same folks who would applaud a mother bear mauling a host of enemies to save her cub, or a woman shooting an intruder to save her child.But they don't extend that to someone restraining a wild child from hurtling into a highway.  Oh, no, if things get that bad, they may reason to themselves (if they reason at all behind the smug little wheels of their Mercedes) then just throw the child away. Don't save it, put it into an institution and forget about it.After all, once it's there, it won't come back to ask why.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
