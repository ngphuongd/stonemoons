She inhabited the lungs of every creature; she worked the bowels and hearts and tongues.Everything lived in harmony with the moon. No one could wish for more than what the moon had given, what she had created.The moon saw this, and it was good. She would come down to earth and the people and animals would feed her. All would rejoice mightily in the great white light as she came ever closer, ever stronger.After the feasting, she would rise back across the horizon and take her place, lighting the stars from her own pale light. Her light grew dimmer as the stars grew brighter, and the people marvelled at the dances of the stars. And all would partake in the dance. This then, was primordial happiness.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
