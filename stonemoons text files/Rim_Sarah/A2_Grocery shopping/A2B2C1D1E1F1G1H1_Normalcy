This ongoing series is brought to you live via the Internet (What did we ever do without e-mail?  I can no longer remember...larger phone bills, probably...)Around three today, Laurel decided she wanted to go for a walk, but Janet went into the garage barefoot and got a glass sliver in her foot. After a soak in the tub, Janet allowed me to douse it with Orajel and work it out with a needle and cuticle scissors. (Where do all the tweezers go?) She hummed and bit her thumb while I worked and barely felt a thing. Janet hopped on her bike, and we allowed Laurel to lead us out. It is noteworthy that Laurel chose not to go out until we were ready. She stood at the door with her comm book and pounded the "This is what is going to happen" page against the doorknob, but she didn't actually touch the doorknob until she saw us.   When she did, she started off down the street, looking back over her shoulder and coming back when she saw we weren't following.  Janet rode her bike, and we brought Kodi on a leash. Laurel walked up Kearney to Yale, then east and into the gas station on Colorado Boulevard when she saw we weren't following. Laurel led us across Colorado Boulevard to the park. As we were going across the busy driveways at the shopping center, she linked arms with me or placed her hand on my elbow. She pushed the button for the walk light at the intersection. Yelling wildly, Laurel made for the slide.  She pushed three different kids down the slide.  Not violently, just sort of helping. One didn't complain, and the other two complained so constantly about everything that their parents kind of dismissed them. She played a bit, accepted that Kodi did not want to go down the slide...after only fifteen minutes of pushing that poor patient dog up the slide ladder. Then she went off to her large elm in the northwest corner of the playground and spread sand into the knothole, watching it spill down to the ground. When the sun left the tree, Laurel indicated that we would leave by heading back a bit and then waiting for Janet and me to scramble after her. While we were at the playground, Janet met a younger man, a kindergartner, though he was her height. He quickly rushed his hands through his dark cowlick and offered the resulting grime to Janet. They held hands and promenaded around the merry-go-round and finally settled on the seesaw. They exchanged crabapple blossoms before he left, and he drew a heart in the sand. Janet raved about his dark blue eyes, thick lashes, and gorgeous nose and informed me he would be back next Saturday. Oh my... Laurel asked for a shower, and actually let me trim her hair for about ten minutes before she took the scissors from me, wrapped them in a wet washcloth, and put them carefully back on the bathroom cabinet shelf at right angles to the cuticle scissors.  Her hair is a bit longer on the front/right quadrant, but there's always tomorrow. What interested me is that Laurel was quite resistant until I started talking about how Jack Cooper (also a younger man—a first grader down the street) thought she was cute.  Then she calmed right down. Oh my.... ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
