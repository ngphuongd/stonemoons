Actually, everything is kinda scary when you think about it, which is probably why I don't try to think about this. If the unspeakable happened to Janet, she would tell me. She knows just what parts of her body are her property—and hers alone. She can point to the appropriate places and name them:  not wee-wee and down there like the girls in the 50's, but mons veneris, vagina, genitalia, like the girls in second grade health in the 90's. We have done the talk about good touching and bad touching, about loving and hurting. Her short stubby fingers fly in my face when we practice "No, No, don't do that!" and "Ewww, go away, I'm calling the cops on you!" Her whole body knows 911. Of this there can be no doubt.Laurel cannot tell me when a dog bites her, when a car runs over her, when she is in so much pain inside she cannot breathe. What will she say when someone enters her world? Will she even know the difference in pain between disturbing her pure-color lights and disturbing her tight-budded flesh?The abuse rate in institutional settings for non-verbal children is over 90 percent.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
