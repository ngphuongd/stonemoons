NOTE:I found some great stories though.  One woman fought the system for years not to institutionalize her cerebral palsied, developmentally disabled child.  She had six other kids and no job.  Finally, she did give in and send the child to an institution. The straw that broke the camel's back? Her washing machine broke and she could not afford to replace it.  And the washing by hand was far too much with the child.Social services was willing to pay the $40,000 a year to institutionalize the child, but not the $600 for a washing machine.##back_________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
