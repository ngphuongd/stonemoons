The moon once revelled in her creation of water and glass that circled like soap bubbles in an endless dance of chaos ~ reflecting the moon's beauty in the silvery prisms of infinite light.   This dance continued for uncounted eternities, until the moon tired of her reflection, and wanted something new.  She stared at the dance until everything shattered into a million, billion stars, each pulling at the tiniest particles, making their own myriads of microcosms.  The fragments went on dancing, and the moon watched until she had forgotten that her creation had once been whole.##Moon ##Sarah ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
