NOTE:There are political factions among parents of autistic kids.  On the one hand, you have the Inclusionists.  The platform is basically "Inclusion, period.  Forget available therapies, forget reasonable accomodation, forget appropriate curriculum.  Inclusion."  My kid deserves the same rights* as everyone else.   The advantage here is that your child is always in the spotlight, always demanding and getting attention*.   Then you have those parents who say, "My kid can't handle inclusion.  Why torture him with noise and activity that overburden his senses?  Why mutilate his self-esteem by forcing him to be in an atmosphere where he can never, ever succeed?"  This second party dreams of a self-contained environment, designed and furnished for their child's specific needs, with at least two trained staff people to coach specific, functional skills in a time-structure tailored for their child's optimal learning.  I guess you could call them the Intensives.  The disadvantage is that it is easier to shut your child up and never think about her again.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
