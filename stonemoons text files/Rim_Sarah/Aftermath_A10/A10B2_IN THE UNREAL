So they went on, happy with the husks of things that had once been and were no longer.The moon gave up her quest to restore the words to life. Yet she could not give up completely. Someday, somehow, she would find the answer.To safeguard the precious words, she wrapped the moonskin parchment carefully in a silver box and welded the locks shut so it would not open. Then she put the silver box into a slightly larger golden one, then the golden one into an oak box studded with amethyst, then an ebony box studded with sapphires, and finally a box carved from moonstones and lined with the bark of the last moontree. She placed this in the bottom of the deepest sea, so that no one would notice it.##go back##press on___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
