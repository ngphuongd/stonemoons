Note:Actually, I can't just leave on that note.  I gotta add that Mr. Cooper has just come over and is mowing the lawn as I type.  I guess Mr. Cooper must have heard this guy going on about my lawn and is doing something about it.  It makes my heart soar to know there are still people like that in the world. ##back
