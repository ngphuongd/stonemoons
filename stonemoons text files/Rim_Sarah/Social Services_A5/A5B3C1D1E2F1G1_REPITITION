This has happened more than once.I have fought the moon for a hundred centuries, a thousand millenia, an infinite number of eternities.I have been the one to burn out witches, stamp out the ever smoldering scourge of hags who would undermine the true order.The only difference is this time I know what I am fighting for.And the price of losing.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
