 The spark of my life flies down the fragile white paper, consuming fragrant shards of old leaves. Its intensity frightens the air around me into waves of smoke, agitating our leaves into consciousness, forcing them to flee under threats of social services, into patterns of catch-22's, between the knives of accusations and counteraccusations. And the spark burns brightest between them as the moon takes a deep drag, holding our soul smoke in her lungs before letting us out of her nicotine ecstasy.##Go back##Press on___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
