To:   Sarah MurphyFrom:   SarahSubject:  Research filesDateLine:   Summer 95I need to get a book, Harding, M.E., 1971.  Woman's Mysteries.  Putnam, NY.   I've been reading "The Riddle of Autism".  In this introduction, he explains the emotional logic behind blaming the mother for autistic child.  He carefully tracks the ancient myths of mothers destroying their children to the medieval scourge of witches and misogyny to the present day Freudian based psychology that lays the blame for the child at the mother's breast. He says:  "If traits incorrectly attributed to autistic children are derived from herioc myths, the same may be true of traits attributed to their mothers...According to Harding, these mothers were the moon goddesses of various cultures, and the sons whom they destroyed were their favorite children."I want to believe that this is all nonsense.  I want my neon lights, my television and computer screens to illuminate the dark corners of the past and tell me it is all some misguided superstition.   Yet I know there is some truth that has survived the interminable passage of generations. Somehow, I know that the moon mother still lives after all these millenia. Her hatred or her desperation (I am not sure which) still forces us to devour our children.  It is this trait, long suppressed by the science of Freudian analysis and encephalograms that comes to the fore when we least expect it.  I must be on guard. I must get this book.Remind me to do this.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
