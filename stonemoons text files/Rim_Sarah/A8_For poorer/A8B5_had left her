To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Psych filesDateLine:  Summer 1989I tried everything I could to handle Laurel's screams.  She had no words, no other language to communicate her anguish.  After she had cried nonstop for over a month, I made an appointment with Doctor Jacobsen, the pediatrician the insurance company recommended.  I told the nurse I wanted to speak with the doctor over the phone first.  She sounded a bit odd as we made the phone appointment, but Dr. Jacobsen called on the dot and did not flinch at the background of screams.  He said to bring her in after hours* so no one else would be disturbed.  I thanked him.When we got there, he took his time.  Slowly Laurel accepted the stethoscope he had warmed in his hand.  He listened for gas, for breathing, for heartbeats.  Tested her reflexes.  Felt for any tender areas.  Held her carefully and told her that he was going to draw blood.  Laurel never stopped her scaled screaming, but she never modulated into the tones of terror either.  After making notes, we set up a phone appointment for the results.  He called back, promptly on the dot with the news that nothing seemed to be out of place physically.  We talked about the asymptomatic weeks that had led up to this sudden onset, the slow development beforehand. I had not realized that at fifteen months Laurel should have been able to speak a few words, understand and comply with complex directions like "turn off the tv" or "come into the living room."   Laurel had done none of these things.  She had seemed content to lie in her crib, staring at her iridescent mobile of the cow, the fork, and the spoon jumping over the moon.He asked if there had been anything emotional that might be causing this, any outside stress.  I told him, there had been some marital difficulties, and actually my husband had left for good the week before this and probably wasn't coming back. He asked if this final breaking point was from the child's screaming.  I said, no, there had been other issues, too.He said there wasn't much he could do and recommended we both see a psychologist.  Gave me some sleeping pills, and nodded when I said I couldn't take them—there was no one to watch Laurel while I slept.  Gave Laurel some children's aspirin just on the off chance it might be physical.##Higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
