Moonstones know they are the moon's shattered bones . Ê They know what the moon has forgotten to tell even herself. They know that I whisper in Laurel's ear she is my sweet moonchild. They know that sometimes I tiptoe over to Laurel and lay my head next to hers on the pillow, listening for her breath.How long will it take, I wonder, for them to call the moon back and tell her where her moonchild is? I shudder at my thoughts. At night I lie awake, too exhausted for sleep. I watch the moon as she steals back across my bedroom window.##Moon##Sarah__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
