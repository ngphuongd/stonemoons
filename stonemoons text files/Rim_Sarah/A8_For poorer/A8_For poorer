Yesterday started incredibly good, but when I took Laurel to get her picture taken for our Christmas cards (yeah, so you'll get them in January or February, what else is new, tee hee.) about 4 in the afternoon, she was hyper and kept trying to jab at my eyes and bite my face. She ran out of the room, through a door marked "employees only." I pursued, yelling "Stop that child!" Would you believe those dildos actually cleared out of the doorway to let her run into the parking lot? Sometimes, people really piss me off.Something I ate (probably at home—I had an eccentric lunch*) disagreed with me, and I went to bed feeling like death warmed over. Mind you, I was not in a well-made bed because the dog, Kodi, had puked on the sheets (and mattress, eww!) and I hadn't had time to wash them. I woke up about 4 cuz Kodi needed to go out. As long as I was up, I guess I figured I might as well throw up and get it over with. Sucked down some Dimetapp and Tums and went back to bed.Somehow we all overslept in the morning (which was actually pretty cool because it was the first solid four hours of sleep I'd had in a hell of a long time.) So we had about a half an hour to get all of us, (including those venerable institutions, the Janet and the Laurel) both to school before I had to be at work. We ran around going nuts and then Janet decided she had to have her pink dress washed. This argument took 15 minutes (she wore her baggy blue pants and purple tee shirt). I got to work at 9:35 and the super called me into her office. They won't be needing my notoriously unreliable presence in the future. And I can forget about references to other day care centers too, thank you so very much.  Rat farts.##delve deeper ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
