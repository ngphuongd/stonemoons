NOTE:This is Laurel's recipe:   In a medium bowl, stir in two cups of water,three tablespoons cornstarch, and a quarter cup Dawn dishwashing detergent.  Swirl gently. Dip hands in and blow. Catch the sunlight if you can. Keep trying if you cannot.  Eat the Sunlight when you have it.I am not sure if it is lunch or bubbles. She eats it anyway. And seems fine for the moment. I join her. The soap sunlight is almost tangy, almost a darkened silver.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
