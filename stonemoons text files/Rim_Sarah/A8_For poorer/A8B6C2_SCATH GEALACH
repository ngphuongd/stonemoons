The harvest moon hangs low, gravid, almost below the horizon. The night air is too still to hear the crickets. We stand, hands tight against the rail on the deck, just staring at her, waiting for clouds to cover her. You can feel her children from here, I whisper to Laurel.We know them.The deep red fullness of the moon's body clings to me.Why can't the moon find her own children, I wonder. Sometimes she seems ready to burst with child. Or is it then that I wake up, knowing her moon child has lost its way and found me?##Moon##Sarah__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
