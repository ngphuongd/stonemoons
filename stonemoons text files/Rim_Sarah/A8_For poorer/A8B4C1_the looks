NOTE:The looks always mean something like "I would never let my daughter out in that condition" (as if the autism or the bare feet or the tousled hair and torn, stained dress were catching).   Or "Well, it is obvious she got what she deserved" (as if this could not happen to anyone decent, to anyone they know, or god forbid, to them.)  Or, worse yet "We are throwing away our scant resources on her?"  This one is hard to answer.  Yes, you don't have enough money. No, Laurel is a human being and deserves as much an education as your children.But as the looks are silent, so are my replies.##back ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
