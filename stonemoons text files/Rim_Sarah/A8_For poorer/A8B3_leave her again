I had to talk with her, if only to make reparations for my poor mothering behind glass, like a prisoner apologizing for her sins, touching the glass as if it were the fingers of the one she has murdered.I was led into a small cement waiting room, with a demarcation line painted firmly on the concrete—white on the top and a dark khaki underneath, as if this stark contrast was all that was needed to fend off the ill winds of feeblemindedness (or whatever terms they were using at the moment).  I opened the door, waiting.  A nurse in a white cap shuffled back over the yellowed linoleum tiles and brought out a limp bundle, wrapped tightly against the cold.  She carried her bundle stiffly, arms outstretched, hands clawing in like the rails on a crib—there only to keep things from falling out of line.  She placed the bundle on the seat beside me.  I opened it slowly, lifting the face from the edges of the starched white sheets.   A thin parody of Laurel's face lay in the depths of the cloth, her image smudged with silence, with tears.   I could not tell if the tears were mine or hers.   She opened her eyes, struggled to get her arms free of the sheets, and held onto my hand.  Her arm clenched mine, her face still impassive, still unmoving.  I held her.She struggled free, still silent.  Walked over to the door and started to pound on it with her fists.   I opened it.  She walked out into the hallway, tugging at my arm in the way she always did to lead me to whatever it was she wanted.  I followed.  We went to the front desk, where she pounded her way along the railing. Over to the double front doors, which she pounded.  I stopped her, showed her how they opened outwards.  She stepped through and pounded the sidewalk.  Dropped my hand, ran over to the car, and pounded on the passenger side.  We left.  I called later, explaining what had happened, and told them we would not require their services.  Naturally, there was a lot more to it than that.  This was the first of the many Social Service visits, explanations, and reports.  But I don't want to get into that right now.##Higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
