NOTE:They all thought I was crazy, but I finally convinced all doctors Laurel had seen to join in one conference call.  At long last, we could talk about Laurel, and not Laurel's behavior separate from Laurel's digestion separate from Laurel's tactile sense separate from Laurel's neurons separate from Laurel's left big toe.  Or so I thought.I hoped we might come up with some novel way of thinking about Laurel. Dr. Jacobsen finally suggested, "Perhaps Laurel is not really in pain.  Perhaps she merely perceives* that she is in pain."Well.  Isn't that novel?##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
