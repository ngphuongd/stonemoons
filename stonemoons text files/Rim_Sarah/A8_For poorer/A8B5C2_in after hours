NOTE:This was the first time that someone had asked me to take Laurel in when no one else would be around.  It was far from the last. I speculated on the motives behind this:*   Good policy--it is easier on Laurel when no one is around and the doctor can see her in more "normal" circumstances.* Good timing--Laurel can take up far more time than a normal child, so seeing her at the end of the day will not make everyone else wait.*   Good business--who would want to go to a doctor who has screaming, uncured children in his waiting room?All the same, in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about segregation.  Do we have unofficial Jim Crow laws for the disabled?##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
