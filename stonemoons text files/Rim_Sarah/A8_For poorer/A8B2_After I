To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Psych filesDateLine:  Summer 1990By her third birthday, Laurel had been screaming practically nonstop for ten months.   Her vocabulary consisted of:¤ a high, keening note which meant she wanted something:  a bottle, a wheel from the Big Wheels toy car to spin, a clean diaper, a piece of moonlight on the wall.  Something, anything.  I was never sure what.  ¤ a dark, low scream that signified pure terror.  I learned to recognize the symptoms and causes of fears:  the front door, a piece of paper, my hands, running water.  Everything, anything became the enemy to be slain through her voice.¤ a ceaseless scale of sound like an operatic banshee that went from a low moan to an inaudibly high squeal.  This was the ultimate air raid that kept everything else at bay and was used whenever the other two were not enough to convey her soul.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
