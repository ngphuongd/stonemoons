I heard a few mutterings from the nurses' station (It really is amazing that your ears can pick up your name in the midst of a hundred other sounds and conversations) to the effect of "that child did WHAT?" and "There has got to be a police record on this one.  Just check it."  and "Social Services could not have said that.  Surely..."  and my favorite, "Well, whatever the situation is, just get it out of here."Apparently, I have a very impressive record.  At last, I qualify for VIP status and treatment—the operating room mysteriously found an opening that very hour, the surgeon was in, and all systems were set to go.    They decided that I hadn't had anything by mouth (which made me wonder if some people really do ingest food by foot, but I didn't ask) for the last 12 hours as I had been in the emergency room bed.  (Somehow, I never did get transferred into the hospital proper, it was a slow night or they didn't know what to do with me, or something).The next thing you know, I was getting prepped for a little early morning surgery.  So another nurse came in and put the anesthetic in my IV.   I just lay there, feeling the cold syrupy lotion travel into my blood and through my system.  After the surgery when I could think logically again, a hospital ombudsman came in with a list of damages.  Seems Candy had given up on pretty short notice and Laurel and Janet were having a lot of fun unattended in the lobby. I didn't get the details and I don't want to even speculate.    The charges involved replacing a television, a pane of glass, three melted* vomit tubs, a broken lamp, etc.  I told the ombudsman I couldn't pay the damages right then.  He asked if I could possibly watch the kids or call someone to do it.  I told him I didn't think so.  One of the nurses overheard this and miraculously came up with Susan, another hospital volunteer (with five kids of her own and well used to chaos).  Susan watched the girls all that day.  She even found a doctor willing to let me go home that night.  (I think that part was probably pretty easy—everyone knew about my kids by the time they were done in the lobby.  Susan drove me home in the evening (which was two yesterdays ago).  She was so glad she could let me off that she didn't follow me inside. Which I was really happy about, because then I didn't have to explain the baked-on blueberry pancakes over the floor behind the front door. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
