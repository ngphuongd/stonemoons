When I drive at night,  the goddess with the curved knife is in my rear-view mirror. I see her scythe across the back seat of the car, coming slowly, lovingly toward my neck.Breathing deeply, I do not panic.  I wait for a red light, pray for a red light.  When it comes, I slow and stop.  Then I reach back and look.But there is only Laurel, asleep.  Janet, in the front seat, sees nothing.  We continue.  I glance back at the rear view mirror, and she is still there, her scythe sharp, undimmed by the streetlights.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
