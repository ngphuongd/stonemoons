I know I don't have answers, but I don't have any questions either. I'm sure I should. What really blew my mind was catching myself in the act of discussing straight-jackets, cuffs, and time out closets for my daughter. I was so calm, it worries me. Shouldn't I be upset? Shouldn't I be demanding that they provide more or better services and make some progress? I really do believe that they are doing everything I could wish. These people are committed to Laurel in a way that puts my mothering in a bad light. They _love_ her. And I do not use that word lightly. They are more knowledgable, patient and compassionate than I am—or if not, they have the added discipline of team support and limited contact. They are doing everything I could suggest and more.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
