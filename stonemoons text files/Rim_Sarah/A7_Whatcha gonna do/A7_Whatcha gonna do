I was asked to attend an informal meeting today. Walked through the white-tile hallways, down a lime green corridor and into the principal's office. There around the battered formica table sat a sea of suits:   Mr. Maycharge, the assistant head of the district, Mr. Maddox, the principal, Ms. Bradshaw, the district coordinator of special education, as well as both Marilyn and Carrie, the teachers. No one said anything at first. Then Marilyn started in in a low voice. Carrie added a contrapuntal voice to the litany of woes. I stared at the wire-cut glass in the window. Bottom line is, they're getting beat up pretty bad and they can't take it unless we find and implement* solutions.  NOW.The district level people were favoring bringing in alternate staff or cutting Laurel's program to give Carrie and Marilyn a break, but the teachers objected that all they need is assurance that something is being done. This is a bit complicated by the revelation that both of them are scheduled for hospital stays in the next two months. (Marilyn has a breast biopsy, and Carrie has only said that her matter does not relate to Laurel or to the school.) That makes looking at some kind of alternate arrangement for Laurel inevitable, either with alternate staff and in-home help, or perhaps a brief placement at an in-patient facility. (About ten days, give or take a few.) Perhaps we will be able to syncopate the medical interventions so that Laurel can remain with someone she knows, most of the time.For now, we came up with these ideas, many of them from me (this is brainstorming, mind you.)¤ Isolate Laurel further¤ Change the staff to give the current teachers a break¤ Keep her home for a while¤ Just ride it out¤ Put her on meds¤ Use aversives to stop Laurel's aggression¤ Restrain Laurel (with a squeeze machine, straight jacket or other device)I brought up the last two and the teachers shuddered and gasped. The district people said they simply didn't do those things. I asked them whyever not? Then I got a little wilder. We could go to the Crypt* and get some fleece-lined leather cuffs for Laurel. When she gets way too aggressive, just cuff her to a post or something and watch for her to calm down. "Oh, no," gasped everyone around the table. "We are far too civilized for 1950's types of restraints," snapped Mr. Maddox as he stood up and straightened his tie. (I'm flashing on noose images, here.)I asked the district head of special services what she thought happened in residential treatment centers. And she said, "Yes, but that was only for helpless cases."The meeting broke up without anything decided. Which I personally thought more mediaeval than cuffs or squeeze machines.##delve deeper ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
