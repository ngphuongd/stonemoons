Creating an environment in which Laurel would be at ease is not part of the consideration. Yet they really did do some contortions to work this out, and I may be able to get something similar for next year, but after that,  there are no programs like this available. We really must move toward less or more restrictive in the near future.I should mention that I believe absolutely that the program they have for Laurel is the best possible; she loves to go to school. Sometimes she dresses and goes on Saturdays, or she leaves the house in the morning before I'm ready. The academic work is appropriate and interesting and constantly reviewed and updated. They do a lot of sensory stuff, like swinging, swimming, gymnastics, pressure stuff to stimulate nerves and calm senses. They analyze each episode of aggression and try to teach Laurel alternative, functional methods of communicating her needs. None of us can find anything in the program to improve.  But we don't know what will happen in the future.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
