But I swear this is true, just the way it happened.Apparently, one of the kids who rides the handicapped bus with Laurel had been out for over a month.  Medically fragile, you know.Yesterday, this kid's mom pushes his chair out to the curb.  The aide fetches up the lift and straps the chair in place.  Along they jounce with their load of disabled kids.  I can see Laurel stroking her face, rocking back and forth and staring at the kid.  She was sitting right across from him, they tell me.Why do they tell me these trivial details, I hear you ask yourselves.  Because when the bus got to the school, there was this big uproar.  It seems the kid in the chair was dead.  Somebody asked the aide if the kid was dead when he got on the bus and she said, "I don't know.  That's not part of my job."##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
