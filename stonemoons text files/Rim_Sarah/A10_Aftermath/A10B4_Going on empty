I just shared that with a friend whose daughter did not quite succeed at commiting suicide.  I can tell you every word and every line in it, but for some reason I can't remember the author's name. Would you please give me the correct reference* so I can credit it appropriately?  I think if I were that guy, just knowing how many lives that poem has saved (or how many times it has saved mine) would be enough to keep him completely happy for the rest of his own life. By the way, the Depakote is not working and the doctor wants Laurel on Lithium starting tomorrow. I need to re-apply for Medicaid because of the possiblity of institutionalization, and I need to get in touch with Ms. Bradshaw at the school to go over their special education options one more time.  I also want to call the pediatrician tomorrow and ask to have Laurel checked for yeast metabolites and for gliadin anti-bodies. Her behavior is just about as bad as it's ever been. The only way she'll communicate right now is through pain:   hitting her head against the wall, pushing me backwards into the wall for a shower, pulling my arm for Doritos and chocolate snack puddings, biting my leg for walks. The back of my head is so matted with blood I haven't brushed my hair in about a week:   I just keep pouring peroxide on it. My arms are bruised, dyed to a hideous purple that would just match that bridesmaid dress from Karen's wedding. I can still walk, but the pain lately has begun to spring small little sideshows all on its own. I don't know what to do. I'm numb. Sorry I keep missing your calls. I like you a lot and am not avoiding you. Promise.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
