Thanks guys, for getting those groceries. And all your help.  I sent that letter demanding resources in over a month ago.  I gotta call and bug them, but they seem to be waiting until the meeting day itself.  Also, I am too preoccupied with caring for Laurel to insist on care for Laurel right now.  If you know what I mean.It's gonna be a long haul.  Needless to say, I have had no income while all this is going on. I had to quit my job.   I have been spending quite a bit on academic materials and transporting Laurel to her community activities, and I've had to pay a lot more than usual for respite care (when and if I can get it at all), since I don't have the school days to do my errands. Something will provide, I'm sure.Janet is doing pretty well. She wants an increased allowance.  I explained to her the difficulties we are in. She said, well, the government does it, why can't we? Smart kid.  I think I'll send her over to the President for some budget lessons.  (Then again, given his rep, maybe not).##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
