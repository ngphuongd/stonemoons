The pain surfaces occasionally, only to fade at the thicket of words now on continuous replay.It retreats into a darkened den I don't usually think about. We both know, somehow, that it will return. But Gonzo holds Janet's face fast as she sings along with the lyrics:   This looks familiar, vaguely familiar. Almost unreal, yet it's too soon to feel yet. Laurel watches, nuzzling my back like a stray fawn, waiting for shadows she can't quite remember.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
