Just to see if there is any way we can get help NOW, this year, this minute.Every other word in this thing is "special."  Special needs, special education, special considerations.Most of us have learned to hate the word "special." It's kind of like the rape of the word "gay." Remember when the gay nineties meant the boating parties, the Degas and Renior strokes of lovely, wealthy people enjoying the innocent sun, the happy flowers, the blushing water? Now all gay means is the spectre of death by AIDs, of alternative lifestyles they don't want in their neighborhood cafes.Special once conjured up images of scrapbooks, crushed roses from special nights. Then it traveled into the realm of blue plate specials and sank even further into the euphemistic depths.  "Special" now means "we don't want her here."  Or am I being paranoid*?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
