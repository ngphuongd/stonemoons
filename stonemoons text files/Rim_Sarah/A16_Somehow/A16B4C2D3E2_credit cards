NOTE:Credit card companies are fascinating.  They don't take "I'm still in med school, we just had a baby, my wife isn't working right now" as legitimate excuses.  They don't see the words  "We will pay next summer when she goes back to work, when I get my residency, when things get better" as substitutions for payments or even promissary notes.They do, however, offer 4.9 percent APR financing for the first two months on any new balance.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
