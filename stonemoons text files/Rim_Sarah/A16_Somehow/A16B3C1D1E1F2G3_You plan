And the first time wasn't a whim either, or else you wouldn't have gotten the burgundy percale 200 thread sheets and matching towels from Walmart the Wednesday before. You told yourself that you needed it for the apartment and it was a great deal at $22.99. You also threw your grandmother's quilt over the unpacked boxes to make a homey table. And the flowers you bought at the King Soopers* were definitely not for you. Anyway, you tell yourself each time you go up the steps, you are only thinking about the inconsequential. Not the consequential feel of his shoulders over your arm as you navigate the narrow turn on the second landing. Not the consequences of what comes next.Each time, your mind agrees with the admonition, and then runs off to rummage through your cabinets. This time, will it be the Grand Marnier left from when you made chocolate cheesecake? Or the Absolut Vodka you bought for the first time (there is about half the bottle left)? Is the 7-up you bought last week still good? Or should you bring out the Light-Dry Cruzan Premuim Rum from the Virgin Islands?You settle on the vodka and orange juice. After all, he knows you are not a virgin.He comes over.  Nothing is as you planned.  He asks what you have done to the place since he was last there. You tell him. He smiles without commenting.His is a mess, he says. Too many roommates studying too many books. No privacy. Besides, he says, somebody pinched my PDR* last night.  This is all he says.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
