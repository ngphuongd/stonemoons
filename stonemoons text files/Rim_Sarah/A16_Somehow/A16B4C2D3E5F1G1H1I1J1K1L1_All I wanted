She did not stop screaming the entire time.Kelly refused to come over. She said she couldn't handle it.  I said I understood.  My boss said my job was no longer waiting for me.  I said I understood.I could not pry Laurel off the toilet lid. I fed her there, sitting on the lip of the bathtub, my knees drawn up, my feet cold on the floor beside her.  We stayed there, Laurel and I, unmoving, uncomprehending.When Laurel finally fell asleep after the sixteenth day, she sighed like a cat leaving off its purr. Slumped to no-longer white linoleum. I carried her to my bed. Brushed her curls away from her face with my finger.I still listen for that sound—sometimes for endless nights that stretch into uncountable days. When she sleeps, I stare at her. Trace her thin brown eyebrows above the smooth curved lashes. Love her closed eyes. I want to do this just once more. Once again. I need to bind her to my soul, in the wordless, mindless way cats do when they rub their scent into where you have been.I knew that this is far too much to ask.  Laurel slept for about 15 minutes and rose again, screaming.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
