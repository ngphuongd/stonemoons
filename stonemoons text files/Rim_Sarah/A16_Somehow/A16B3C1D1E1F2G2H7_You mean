Finally, someone to validate my entire existence, just like in the fifties. Thanks God, I needed this*.""What is it about doctors that I want to love one? You'll never be there, we'll have no future, but my mother would be so happy.""Your hands are so soft, and while your body is not quite drop dead gorgeous, you feel so good with me that I couldn't bear it if you went away.""My mind is not in gear right now, but my body is*. I'll just let it have a night on the town for once. I might check for messages in the morning.""Great! I'm horny as hell and now I have a chance to do something about it.""I need to have you touching me, covering me, all over again.""I need to know you love me now and forever*. Or at least for as long as I need to know this."This, too, is probably a multiple choice quiz. You love him, you love him not, and it means just about as much as pulling the wings off daisies*. So you lean back in the wood chair, you shoulders just missing the bevelled edges on either side, and stare at him. In the harlequin romances you devoured as a kid, this is called staring up at him lovingly, or gazing longingly into his dark green eyes, except in the books the eyes almost always border on purple and you have never really seen this. So you just stare and wonder. And tell your mind to go take a hike. And only come back when you don't see the tie on the door, ok?##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
