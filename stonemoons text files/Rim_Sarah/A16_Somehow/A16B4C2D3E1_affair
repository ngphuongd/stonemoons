NOTE:This had, of course, been going on for quite some time.  It's easy to make excuses to be somewhere when you are in med school—you need to study, research, write a paper.  But when the library closes at midnight and you come home at two am, something is probably up.This I pieced together later, particularly after I found the love notes that were not addressed to me*.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
