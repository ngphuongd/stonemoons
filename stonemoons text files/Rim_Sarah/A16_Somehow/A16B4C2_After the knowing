To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  January 1987 You end up getting married anyway.  This is what you decide before you leave the table, ending the discussion.  It's the best choice and you won't back out.  You stare at the counter.  He pockets the bill.As she clears the table and takes your now cold coffee, the waitress swings her lanky braids and says congratulations.  You are not sure if she is telling you congratulations for convincing him that this is the right step, that you will be a great wife, that he needs this marriage as much as you do.  You do not know how much of the conversation she has heard.  Maybe she is telling him congratulations for not dying, for not killing you.  You can not tell how well she knows him.You speak with your father.  He tells you that this is exactly what he expected from you.  The finances are arranged. You'll keep your job, just take a few months maternity leave.   Your father has a new partner in a real estate venture.  Your father will find the house.  A wedding present.  Without rent, you two can probably make it through the rest of his residency, and then things will work out just fine.  He does not tell you about his family.  Not even if any will come to the wedding.Your sister Kelly embroiders two samplers:  one with the wedding date and a blank one for the child. She puts the moon and stars on the one for the child. "Your favorite," she says. She puts a yellow rose* on the wedding one. "It looks cheery," she says. "Hopeful." You do not tell her what the old books say this means*.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
