NOTE:Yet, when you think about it, you really do. You are your mother's progeny, her little helper, and your greatest fear is that her dependancy will rub off on you. Then you, too, will resent the hell out of it and try to get out of Dodge, too, and end up burning your life away. Then you think about it—what is there really to burn?##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
