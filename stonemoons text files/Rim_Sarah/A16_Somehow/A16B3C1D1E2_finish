NOTE:Of course, you aren't really sure you'd make it to the finish on Beaver Brook trail.  You haven't finished anything from the day you were born, is the way your father would put it.You'd probably hit about halfway, past that third rockfall, and suggest a slight detour to that meadow ringed with aspen and the soft ferns.  By the time you were done there, you would both be a little to weak to walk up to Chief Xosa.  So you would find an excuse just to turn around and walk back down the trail, hand in hand.  If nothing else.Let alone finishing anything for the rest of your life.##back_____________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
