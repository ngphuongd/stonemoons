The girl stood in the doorway without Laurel, her ears stopped with toilet paper, her jaws furiously chewing gum.   I asked her where Laurel was, told her I was sorry I was late, that it wouldn't happen again.  She said that Laurel was in the bathroom, screaming.  And that it definitely wouldn't happen again, because Laurel had been screaming for the second day in a row.  They simply couldn't go on like this.I said Laurel hadn't been screaming last night, that it must be something in the air at the day care, something in the formula, maybe one of the other kids set her off.She said, no, that Laurel started to scream about a half hour after I left and was still going strong.  I could hear her in the bathroom, a high, keening note like the baying at the moon.I took her home.  She did not stop.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
