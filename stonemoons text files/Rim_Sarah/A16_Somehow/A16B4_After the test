The coffee cups at the Almond Cafe are impossibly thick. You hold your cup, waiting for the warmth to penetrate. It doesn't. You tap the waitress, who is tugging at her lanky long brown braids, and signal for more coffee. You wait, staring at the posters on the newly painted walls, the free mags on the thick window shelf. You stare, any place* but him. He asks you what is wrong. You tell him.  He stares out the window.  You want to stroke his hair, shining in the sunlight, but you keep your hands busy playing with the sugar packets, tapping the sweet grains to the bottom of the paper.  You wonder if they would understand your voice.You begin to babble a bit. You say things like "I always said that although I think anyone should be able to get an abortion, I could never tear out my own flesh like that. Even though it isn't my flesh really, it is me, it is inside me. And it is mine."  Neither of you is listening. He says things like:  "Christ, goddamnit. I have 2 more years of med school. Plus residency. There is no way I could take care of a child. Or you. Look at you. You're nothing but a child. And put that straw down."  You have never seen his brow furl this way.You want to tell him you need a straw because the coffee is too hot this time. But you say nothing. After all, you think, there is really nothing you can say.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
