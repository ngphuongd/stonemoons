To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  February 1989It has happened again.  As the life quickens in my belly, I tighten inside, wondering how to tell him.Dear, I have a very special graduation present for you.  It'll come just about three months late for your graduation, but I'm sure you won't mind that.Hi, honey, remember the condoms we didn't use?Or maybe just the simple, straightforward, I'm knocked up again.  What do we want to do about it?  Laurel continues to scream, day and night.  I think I will have to find someone to sit for the night so I can tell him.  In a quiet coffee shop, the Almond Cafe perhaps.Of course, I can't find a sitter even for the evening.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
