NOTE:Laurel's paraphenaliaÑthe bottles and diapers and safety pins and baby suits and baby seat and swing and toysÑ deluged every room of the house until I could no longer hold back the waves.  Everything was flooded with stains and spills and unmade beds and undone dishes.  Even his study.  ##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
