Has the moon ever used the words "I love you"?  Are these the sounds the moon whispers to the clouds as they caress her?It is the cryptic language the moon would embody, would take to herself as lovers, drawing them about her as she does thin lengths of revealing clouds in a darkly clear sky.  This is what she would mean as she changes her face in the night.This would be her gift to me.  Here have these three words.  Have anything you want them to mean.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
