To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  Summer 1987Laurel was not born* like an iris unaware—first a thick bud, now a full fledged flower.  I was aware of her at every moment.  Of course, I was aware of precious little else, like the affair* he was having or the bills* he wasn't paying or the house that was not as clean* as it used to be.I slept by her crib in the basement so I would hear her, let her tiny fingers hold onto mine, filled her ears with the softest talks.  Told her about daffodils in sunshine, dragonflies over the stream, swift black scaled snakes hidden under rosebushes.  Held her up in the moonlight to see the Malaysian hunchback sitting under a banyan tree of clouds, weaving the fishing line.  Sang to her about the rat that eats the line as fast as the hunchback makes it, so that he cannot fish for mankind.   Whispered lullabies, narrated sweet dreams.  Told her not to cry.  And she didn't.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
