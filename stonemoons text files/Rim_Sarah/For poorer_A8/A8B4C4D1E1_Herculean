Papers for Laurel's IEP, her meds, her therapy litter the floor. Bills spill over from my desk onto old dog droppings Laurel brought in from somewhere. I would scream but then Laurel would join in and we would never stop.  I cannot remember how Hercules cleaned the Aegean stables.  I seem to recall something about a maiden crooning to him, singing while floods cleared the stench of a thousand years.  He has a nice relaxing day, wakes up refreshed, and claims his reward.I want someone to croon for me.  I cannot croon for myself.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
