But the memory of my sweet Laurel was locked too carefully within the moon's bones.Slowly, the arthritic memory stole over her bones, wakening in the cold fog air.  Her calcium caves remembered my Laurel dancing in her green and yellows .  This vision turns the moon inward, cell by cell, like sap stealing out of the aspen, coloring the hills with my memories.##Moon##Sarah__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
