The bad news is that the reason everyone is reasonable is that no one can see any options. It was a long discussion, and just to make myself feel better, I've typed it all out here. At one point, Ms. Bradshaw even said, "Keeping Laurel out right now is illegal. We can't even do that. But we don't have any other options even for tomorrow." and I allowed as how under the circumstances, I would accept that until we could figure out something. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Here's the sitch:   Laurel was suspended for 10 days. (Which Mr. Maddox mentioned under his breath is only a hundredth of the time most people get for assault and battery). Before she will be allowed to go back to school, Mr. Maddox needs "reasonable assurance" that people will be safe. Also, we've all agreed that having Laurel back in school while she's likely to be throwing conspicuous tantrums or doing major damage is very bad for PR; nobody's going to be willing to have her integrated into their classroom, even when her teachers say her behavior has improved enough to make it safe.For everyone to be assured beyond a reasonable doubt that Laurel is OK to return to school, we need Ms. Scratcherd, the district psychologist, and another professional to observe Laurel in a situation with similar demands to the school setting. That means there has to be some other place where the teachers can work with her. To assure the teachers' safety, the principal insists (and the teachers back this up) that there be two trained people with Laurel at all times. Here comes the part we disagree on; the second person cannot be me, and the place cannot be my home; because of the relationships already established, the signals to Laurel, and the overall leadership, this would be "confusing."To complicate matters just a tiny bit further (Ok haul out the one ton Excedrin and swallow hard here), most of the major players (including yours truly) will be out with medical complications.Not only does Carrie have to recover from her broken jaw, she is out for surgery (unrelated to Laurel) until at the very least April 6th. Marilyn has to have a breast biopsy Thursday, and wouldn't Laurel just be heavily into punching breasts right now. The usual back up staff person refused and the other one is newly pregnant, and we all agree she is not to work with Laurel and take these risks right now.And I have to go in to get a cyst off my ovary, along with a biopsy. Like, soon. Because it would be real nice if I didn't collapse in pain and let my two kids run wild and free even for a few minutes.So Marilyn is unavailable until next month and her second staffer is out for another two weeks. Laurel cannot be removed from school for more than ten days without major Individualized Education Plan review and rewrite, and that requires my approval or some pretty heavy legal stuff to overrule my objections. . . which they probably couldn't do since the reason Laurel will be out is primarily their failure to provide staff. And in any event, they couldn't do it before the ten days is up, and they'd legally have to keep her in the current program until whatever decision was reached. Again, the good part is that they're completely on the table with all this; nobody's bluffing about how they might interpret the law and daring me to go to litigation to do anything about it.Again, the bad part is there is nothing I can do. And everyone left again without any options.  Ms. Bradshaw did offer me coffee. I put cream into it, letting everything swirl into the depths. I told her, "See, there is consensus at least in the bottom of my coffee cup." They all decided this was a joke in poor taste.##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
