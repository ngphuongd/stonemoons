The moon's eyes* peer over the horizon, blood dark, gravid. They pierce through the insubstantial clouds and stare down at us.Waiting.The moon's eyes know they cannot pierce through the curtains that these gestures of friendship weave.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
