NOTE:Yes, Virginia, there is a 24 hour RugDoctor on Sheridan and Colfax. Not a neighborhood to venture in late at night. Janet wanted to know what the pretty ladies were doing by the Bugs Motel. I told her that they were trying to get someone to pay them for being pretty. Why? she asked.They need money for food, I tried to explain further. And the only thing they have to sell is their bodies*.She immediately informed me that she wanted to do the very same thing.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
