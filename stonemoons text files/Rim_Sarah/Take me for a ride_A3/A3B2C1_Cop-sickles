Then I could shout the punchline at the top of my lungs and everyone would laugh along with it.OTOH, you may find new appreciation for your folks...Dad asked me to look after his three tanks of fish (a beta, some neons and some discus) and two parakeets while he was out of town for three weeks. Dad didn't call to check in at any point during his trip. He hadn't actually left me a key to his house.  (No, no!  That's just what they'd be expecting!)  I could practically hear desperate little fish voices crying for food as I circled the place, pushing windows, sliding my library card along door cracks, the girls trailing behind me with a rising murmur that bespoke louder protestations to come if something sensible didn't happen soon.  So I finally broke a small window in the side of the house and climbed in, leaving Janet and Laurel out in his backyard. Janet found a compost heap and started digging, while Laurel hummed the tune for "Peanut, peanut butter" at the top of her lungs.Naturally enough, the next door neighbor called the cops. After all, who would break into someone's back window at seven o'clock at night, yelling idiotic lyrics? Obviously, it had to be someone who was mentally disturbed, at the very least. It's a great neighborhood; by the time I let the girls in, there was a knock at the door.  I open up the front door, and the cop has his gun partway drawn.  (I guess you never know what you're going to find with a call like that.)   Laurel, eagle-eyed child that she is, saw the glittery flash and dove for it.  Bless the guardian angel on duty, I caught her before she could grab the pistol or I don't want to think what would have happened. Her momentum spun the two of us around in a complete circle, which confused the cop for a moment.  The cop, a big burly man who resembled nothing more than an overgrown cigar, gave out in a deep, gruff voice, "Ma'am, we've had a report of a disturbance here—are you the owner of the house?"I say, "No, I'm his daughter." The guy shifted on his heels and said, "Can I see some i.d.?"I tell him its in the car.  He thinks it would be just spiffy if he went with me to get it.  On the way, he notices the window, which is backlit from the light in the hallway. He says, "What happened here?" in a voice that said he was likely to cart all of us off at any moment.I told him the story, showed my i.d. He called in on his computer, matching my license. Then he said he'd escort me through the house to see if we could find some verifying evidence. I said ok. We went back in. While we'd been so pleasantly chatting outside, Laurel had discovered art supplies and gone waltzing through the house decorating Dad's priceless oriental rugs with tastefully applied tessalations of Ked prints in Colgate. The cop looked ready to add vandalism to my obviously growing list of crimes. How we got through all that, you don't want to know.  Neural defenses are blurring the details in my mind even as I write. I seem to recall a toppled file cabinet, a broken toe (the cop's, not any of ours), several packages of orange starbursts (to get Laurel into the shower so she would stay there while I cleaned up the rugs), and two late-night trips to Rug Doctors*.The cop was back outside when we finally finished cleaning and feeding and leaving. He was writing me a ticket for an expired emissions sticker.  Apparently, my sense of self-preservation had also expired, because I explained to the cop that this was a shitty thing to do to an obviously-frazzled mother at this particular hour, and that protection and service would be better defined by arresting drunk drivers than by exercising a personal vendetta for his fractured toe and bruised ego by abusing his authority to make people's lives miserable by picking on minutia.This was a mistake. We all piled in his car and went down to the station for disturbing the peace.  I decided I might as well relax and enjoy the relative safety.  My head dropped back.  My eyes closed for just a moment.  Laurel saw her opportunity to bring out the kidnapped Colgate and add some needed artistic flare to the partition.  This particular cop does not appreciate fine art.  He was able to add vandalism of a state vehicle to the list of charges*.They tried to take the girls into another room, but Laurel started slamming her head into a wall, so they brought her back to me.  The cop apparently had noticed the odd behavior he never quite commented on, and a representative of the Child Protection Gestapo was sent for.  She glanced over the papers, tossed a cat-like smile in my direction and told the sergeant, "We are aware of this family.  We don't want these children."  And she left.I'm not entirely sure whether I feel relieved or appalled.Ok. Ok. To make a long story even longer, we got home around 3 am.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
