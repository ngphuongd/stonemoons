Anybody got a spare samurai suit? I dunno. I have some alarms I need to get up on doors, and I want to replace the broken front door lock. I'm calling all over trying to find a pshrink we can work with.Obviously, I'm going to take the next opportunity I have to check in with some clerical contracting agencies to find some kind of type-at-home kind of work, so I won't be financially ruined if this doesn't all clear up soon.I'm not sure what I need. It's so bloody complex right now I feel all tangled up. Perhaps I'll make a list.  ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
