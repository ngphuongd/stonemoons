The jaw has to heal and probably some other stuff, too. Marilyn's explanation yesterday was:   Laurel was upset about not getting her way somehow and was pounding on Marilyn. Carrie came up behind Laurel and Laurel rocked her head back into Carrie's face. That explains Marilyn's voice on the phone; she was feeling partly responsible for Carrie getting hurt. Or it's possible that she was downplaying the incident.  I dunno. How do you downplay an attack that leads to a broken jaw?  So we'll see. I'm headed up to the hospital now. I don't know how I will explain why I haven't been there already—break down and tell the truth*, I guess.   I couldn't find anyone to stay with Laurel.  After we got back from the school, Laurel started to walk back out to the school. She must have needed to finish something--or we went out the wrong door and she needed to reverse the circuit. But I knew the dire consequences if she were to go back.  Riots would break out in all of the peaceful, tree lined and kentucky-blue-grassed yards.  People would overturn and burn BMWs, Hondas, Geo Metros, anything just to get away from her.  The universe would wrench open and fall apart.So I used every ounce of strength I had to wrestle her into her room.  On the way (which took about a half an hour subjective time and an eon in heroic time), she managed to gouge my cheek (which is still bleeding), pull out more of my hair, and blackened my  and burnother eye (the good one).How's everybody out there in reality land?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
