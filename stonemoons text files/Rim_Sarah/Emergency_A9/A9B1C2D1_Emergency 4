About 6. She said not to bother calling the school. Laurel was suspended for yesterday. I said, "She can't be suspended for anything disability related.""Yes," said Marilyn. "Only this wasn't disability related. It had to do with the teacher's safety."And there was nothing I could say to argue with that. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
