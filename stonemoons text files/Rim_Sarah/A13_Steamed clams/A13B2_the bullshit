NOTE:I am finally beginning to understand what is going on. As part of my quest for inner peace to avoid beheading my darling children, I have been reading the Tao Te Ching, the Tao of Pooh, the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Qabalah, the Sayings of the Compassionate Buddha, and Deepak Chopra.  I have discovered a universal truth about prophets of great wisdom.They spake.To the best of my knowledge, I have never spake.  This could be why the school district honchos treat me like a derelict.  I speak.  I have spoken.  Where's the credibility in that?As I consider, I recall that The Experts I have consulted (and there have been many) have told me things, recommended articles, nodded sagely.  One or two even listened compassionately.  But I cannot remember a time even when Dr. Frawley spake unto me.  And she probably came closest of anybody.From now on, when I talk to an expert, I am going to ask myself, "Did he or she spake?"  And if the answer is "no", I'm going to consider for myself whether what he or she said (merely _said_, mind you) makes any sense, or whether it is just more bullshit to cover up base motives (such as a lack of money, a desire to maintain professional superiority and pretend they know much more than I do, or a stampede for an easy way out—no matter what that does to Laurel).In the meantime, I am going to practice spaking.  If anyone has any information on spaking techniques, or can recommend a good website, please let me know*.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
