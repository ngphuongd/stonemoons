The inevitable consequence was of course, an immediate return to pain's icy grips (pain's hot grasp?  Which would sound better in the romance novel?)  They let me stay in the emergency room, and I met Candy, a pretty teenager with black lipstick and eyeshadow who was going to watch the girls until we figured out what was going on.  I told her some of how to handle Laurel and wished that I had thought in my infinite wisdom and foresight to bring Laurel's emergency book, which shows her condition, what frightens her, what calms her.  But Candy seemed willing to try (which in my book at least, equates right up there with competent—you're hired!) and she said the kids were tired and sleeping in one of the quiet rooms they reserve for grieving families.  I told Candy there was nothing to grieve about here, just an upset stomach or something relatively minor like that.  She said, "Good, keep it that way."  I told her I fully intended to.The ultrasound revealed a massive mass on my right ovary.  A white coated woman with a too-large nametag, Dr. Michelson, showed me the pictures:  a bloated blurry mass sticking on top of another shadowy mass. I nodded sagely.  She took out a laser pen—the fancy way of professional pointing nowadays—and the red light played off some bumps and molehiles.  Then I nodded again when she mouthed the words ovarian cyst and biopsy and immediate surgery.   She then said womething about chances of the mass being potentially malignant, chances of the operation cutting of blood supplies to my foot (or maybe it was some other important organ, I confess, I wasn't really paying attention.  I wanted to know about the girls and was wondering if she would know or care.)Doctor Michelson looked at me oddly when I said I needed the surgery right that moment so I could go home and take care of the kids. "I have to feed them breakfast tomorrow morning. Get Janet off to school. And Laurel is out of school right now—so I have to watch her."She peered at me over her glasses. "Don't you have anyone else to watch them?" she asked*. "No." I said. "There really isn't anyplace for them to go.""Usually, it takes a while to schedule these things.  Can't you talk with your regular physician?" she  made notes on her chart.  When I told her I didn't have time for a regular physician, she shrugged and went out. ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
