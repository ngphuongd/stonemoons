Each would go mad in their fashion ~ until people no longer gave any credence to madmen. The people hid themselves from the moon's touch ~  afraid of remembering what they once knew, afraid of knowing what they missed.So the moon decided to create her own daughter, who might have the strength she lacked. So she took my blood and fashioned Laurel.She mingled our cells together, sculpting the crescent nose, high arched eyebrows, long brown hair that shone dark in the moonlight.She played with the ganglia, the nerves from in each part of her running together in cloud patterns to mirror the sky.And waited while I gave birth.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
