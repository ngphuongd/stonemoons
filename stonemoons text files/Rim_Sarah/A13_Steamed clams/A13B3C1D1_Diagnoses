I am no longer human, but patient.  My arms and breast are barely covered in a snap-on piece of cloth that doesn't snap; my right wrist is encircled with plastic that never quite touches my skin, as if I am not worthy of the hospital's touch.  I do not think about the needle in my arm, the shivering that hits the nerve so close to the surface of my arm and sends rivulets of pain down to meet the buckets of pain in my belly.Instead, I think about what is in a blue plastic bag with the official stamped logo "patient's belongings."  My clothes, an old pen that does not work, my car keys (I think), some Old Maid cards and a couple of scrabble letters, and maybe an orange starburst or two.  These used to be on the chair in the curtained-off area of the emergency room, but now I think they are abandoned somewhere. Are the girls in the bag? I ask myself, which is a completely irrelevant and silly thing to think, I think next.  Then I wonder.  And mentally retrace my steps to find my lost articles.I did not see the girls while I waited in the emergency room bed, pressed up against the silver railing.  I did not see them when two guys, one with straight brown hair and a long straight nose and the other blonde head buried somehow in a clipboard transfered me to the wheeled stretcher.  I tried to turn my head as the hallway whirled past, but I'm pretty sure I did not see the girls then, either.  I try to ask the guy with the brown hair, but his eyes are looking at the elevator and he does not hear me.  I turn to ask the other one, but the jarring, the pain drowns my voice.Then the lights are too bright to ask anything and the doctor is talking about something he wants to do and he wants another signature.  I hold my hand up to the paper and ask about the girls.   He says not to worry about that.  He smears my belly with something cold, slimy.  Of course, I think, it is no longer my belly, just as the girls are no longer my girls.  We all belong to the hospital now.Still, it is odd that I can remember my thoughts and not be in my thoughts at the same time.  I think there might be something in the IV that makes me feel this way.  I wait while the machines around me whir, click. I cannot turn my head to see them.  ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
