Of course not, I haven't even told myself yet. And myself should be the first to figure this one out. But I really haven't had a chance to breathe, let alone think.Well, let me start with the fact that I can actually sit up. This is good. I must announce to the world in general that I can breathe without turning the insides of my diaphragm out with pain. This is even better. I can even stand and walk a little. But not much.Two days ago (it seems a lifetime:  pain must be measured in such different quantities:  yes, thank you, I'll take two weeks worth of time dressing on that one minute salad) I was sitting on the living room floor, minding my own business... (Well, actually Janet and I were playing Old Maid and Junior Scrabble at the same time, so the whole floor looked like one big game show and we were giggling pretty hard. She loves it when I trump the old maid and then put some x's over the cards.) ....When all of a sudden, my insides turned into a nightmare of knives. Pain shot through me and under me, cutting off any possible avenue of breath, of escape. Funny, now I can't even describe the pain, I just remember the bare fact of pain, the naked horror of it all. The sensations of pain choke so strongly and then leave just as suddenly, erasing their memories as if they  never existed at all.  Someone should write a doctoral thesis on this phenomenon.  Call it the aesthetics of pain or something.Laurel started whirling around the room, humming what in other circumstances I would have sworn was a Viennese waltz.  Janet tossed the game board aside and plowed through the cards willy-nilly to reach me.  I don't think either of us cared one iota about the score (in fact, the cards are still there, a little stomped on and maybe a bit worse for wear, but nonetheless hopeful that we may one day continue that game.)Janet looked at me with large fawn eyes, pressing her small hand against my pouring-sweat forehead. "Mommy, be ok," she pleaded softly. "Mommy, be ok." When it was pretty clear to her that Mommy was not ok, she ran to the phone, dialed 911 and carefully said "Mommy is sick, please come." She gave her name and address, just like I taught her.   Then she stayed on the line and told me that the 911 lady said that someone was coming.  She asked if it was ok if she told the 911 lady what her favorite candy was, and then when I didn't answer, she said, Mommy taught me not to talk to strangers.  Are you a stranger?  No, then my favority candy is M&M's but I only like the blue ones.  Red ones are made of spider dye and the brown ones are from cow shit."  Janet kept burbling on to the 911 lady, who must have been fascinated by the conversation, because she kept Janet on the line until the door thudded and shuddered under the knocks.  Or maybe that was just my body. I'll write more when I can sit up again.SarahP.S.  It will never cease to amaze me how great kids are.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
