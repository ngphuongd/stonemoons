And I am not alone in the gas chamber.I went to the respite host home, and it's an ok place. Clean, without any smokers like the last time. But I don't want to go into details right now.The thing is, to get funding, the schools want to go through the foster care system.  And that means I have to make Laurel a ward of the courts.  They tell me it's just a technicality.  But "technically" what it says is that I wouldn't have the authority to make decisions about medications, or to bring her back home.  Basically, the school district would have full custody.Really, the only way they'll provide services is if I place her in the home, and then only if it's tacitly understood by all parties that this is pretty much permanent—no matter what.  Then and there, I decided I couldn't take the bullshit* anymore.  I very calmly said, "Wait a minute. Permanence is way unacceptable. This was a temporary option because there WEREN'T any other options at the moment. You can't blackmail something like this into a final solution."Marilyn told me that the school considers that I am willfully holding Laurel out of school now, because technically she was only suspended through Monday. Yet they have given me no other options before next Monday, which is the very first time we can put her in the home. So therefore and QED, if I don't agree to the residential home, they will sue me for maternal neglect, social services will take the child and that will be the end of the line, thank you very much.So I have a placement review meeting tomorrow at 12:30. The advocate from Association for Community Living will be there, but she and I have not had time to discuss what's going on. Apparently, if I want to delay putting Laurel in this place, they will consider that I am willfully holding her out of school for that time, too. More charges of abuse and neglect for Mom. Furthermore, my refusal of services will justify the school district to refuse to offer future services. Of any sort. This is soo mega-illegal I can't begin to tell you.So, it boils down to I either disobey the laws and keep her home, or I lose her entirely.  "In the best interest of the child," huh?  Thank you, Child Protection Gestapo. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
