She stayed so close to me, and I tried not to move, not to frighten her away.  She stroked my hand with the light wings of a butterfly— as if her soft flesh could take away my pain, like it takes away a kitten's fears. I tried to speak, to tell her everything was ok, that her mommy would live forever, not to worry. But the pain grasped me mercilessly and would not let me go.  The thudding from the paramedics at the door spooked her, though, and she went humming back into her room and locked herself in.Janet opened the door and six burly firefighters hurtled in, crowding my living room and stomping over the old maid cards. The paramedics got me on a stretcher, got an IV going and tried to get me into the ambulance.I thought wildly that this must be what it is like to live on those romance covers, swooning into the golden hair muscles that will hold you forever.   From somewhere I got the strength to say I would not go anywhere without Laurel. They asked if I had anyone who could look after her. I said no, no one.Janet gravely informed the paramedics that Laurel was locked in her room.  They, quite naturally, asked for the key.  Janet said that Laurel must have eaten it.  They looked over at me for a little more elucidation, but I was a wee bit preoccupied with the pain monster that was claiming my body as its personal property.   Janet told them that it was not a good idea to knock on the door because that would scare Laurel.   Under the circumstances*, I suppose that it was pretty natural for them to think something hideous had happened to Laurel.  They conferred, and a tall guy took an ax to the door—mere wood being unimportant when it comes to saving lives.This cacophony probably scared Laurel half to death.  And I can imagine the scene—Laurel cowering in fear for her life, the paramedic trying to reach her to save her life.  I managed to croak out "Peanut, peanut butter" and Janet joined in on the song.  The paramedics probably figured that the whole place was a loony bin and they might as well join in too.  So to summarize the whole thing, we all sang  "Peanut, peanut butter" all the way out to the ambulance.   Then Laurel discovered that she didn't have her shoes on and refused to get into the ambulance. (It is a law for her that she can't leave the house without her shoes—a fact that is very handy when you don't want her to go anywhere but is a nuisance when you do.) Janet ran back in and grabbed an old pair of sandals.  Laurel gravely sat down beside me in the back of the ambulance and put them on.   At this point, I think the paramedics had had it because they let her stay in a jump seat in the back—after she put her seat belt on, of course. I don't know where they kept Janet and Laurel in the emergency room. I don't even remember asking. The pain demanded all of my attention and more. I think it wanted my life, but I told it my soul was sticking to my cells for a while longer. Just a little longer. Then I think I went to sleep.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
