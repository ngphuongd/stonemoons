This, you thought, might help. I thik it might too, but we've been trying so many so fast that I am not sure what is meds, what is outside forces, and what is just Laurel. Anyway, we've been doing different regimes since last year. First was Anafranil  (clomipramine) then Depakote, and then the new guy recommended Lithium*, but I haven't started that yet (and haven't told the pshrink I'm not doing it) because I am waiting to get the DAN! protocol and talk to the ped and the pshrink about how to progress in light of that information.  Also, I need to check with the PDR* and see if these are contraindicated for Laurel. (And I used to be such a TRUSTING soul, too!)You guys also wanted to know if I did meds. . . maybe something is hereditary and what worked for me will work for Laurel. It is worth a shot, but meds never really helped me. A pshrink did prescribe Lithium when I was a teenager. Lithium made me walk into walls. I found that aerobic exercise and cutting the artificial crud and allergens out of my diet, and a little attitude adjustment worked better and was health-oriented instead of disease-oriented. I know you guys are concerned about my current state of health, and believe you me, I am too. I've been depressed and nearly suicidal lately, but I really think that the way I feel is a rational reaction to an insane situation rather than an intrinsic thing. When your flesh and blood is determined* to make mincemeat out of you and there is no one around to help, even for a moment, it tends to get you down a bit.   A couple of you offered some stuff, but you would be mailing it from California, and I'm not altogether sure that that is legal anywhere outside of the Dream State. Further, although pot or crack might help for a very short while, it would probably mess things up in the long while. (Actually, I did coke twice as a teen, and it had no effect whatsoever. So hard drugs are probably a waste of money.)  St. John's Wort, on the other hand, or Valerian and Skullcap, these might be interesting.   Anyone know of a health food store that does deliveries around here?##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
