Apologized for the loose wire*.   Somehow, we must have gotten disconnected.   Awfully unreliable, these telephone companies.Anyway, we talked a while about the appropriateness of the New Jersey school. She is going to drop by pamphlets.  She gave me the URL* so that I could look it up on the web.  Naturally, I got a 404 error*--there is no such page.  I think she'll simply say the server was down and will give me the URL again.  I don't think she is going to give up on this place merely because I can't find their website.I think she felt the tiniest bit guilty, because she agreed finally that it really wasn't the mother who is being disruptive.  And if we did finally settle on New Jersey, the district would send both Laurel and me out there. The school had a dorm, so I could stay as Laurel got settled in.  (I would have to come back, because if I lived out there, then I would not live in the Colorado district, and the State of Colorado would no longer pay for Laurel to be in New Jersey.)  It is these catch-22s that she just doesn't want to see—or maybe that she doesn't want me to see"But my dear, don't you see how free you would be with this?"  Ms. Bradshaw asked.I told her that much freedom would kill me.  "How would you like to be separated from your daughter for years at a stretch?" I  asked."Oh, sometimes I think I wouldn't mind at all." she replied, and I could just see her tossing her long black hair back from her face and smiling wryly.I said I appreciated the gestures, but that I was still far from convinced that this was the right place for Laurel.  I wasn't at all sure about their methods of behavior modification, the fact that they could change meds any time they wanted, etc.  The usual shop talk, the pro talk, the MOM talk.Ms. Bradshaw finally said she'd look around.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
