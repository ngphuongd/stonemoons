My soul wandered through the prison of my body, rattling my cell doors, begging my blood for release. Her voice once high and imperious, faded colder with each passing breath until it was merely a pleading sigh, soft as unblooded snow. Her thoughts~once scarlet with anger at her jailers, throwing mad visages of murder, of pulling each cilia slowly out of each phagocyte~slowly eased into the nothingness of captured ice. ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
