The moon's phagocytes course through my system like rogue eating machines set loose for a sweet chocolate Sunday afternoon. There are far too many, and they are far too invisible to blame, to tell someone, to say here lies the legion of culprits. Yet they are grazing on my soul, feasting on each small memory, tiny triumph, backward glance. Consuming the ephemera, the things far too trivial to matter. Don't worry, the moon laughs lightly at me, telling me that even one of her phagocytes would take a millenia to devour only a microcosm.Do I have the strength any more to tell her my soul is too insubstantial to nourish my own cells, with nothing to spare for hers?___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
