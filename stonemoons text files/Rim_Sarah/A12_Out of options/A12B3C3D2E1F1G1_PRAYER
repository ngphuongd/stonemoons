I want to ask the moon if we can try again. I want to do something, anything, other than this macabre dance around the absence of beyond.But I do not dare. Considering what the moon has done to me already, every cell in my being shrinks from bringing her gaze upon me once again.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
