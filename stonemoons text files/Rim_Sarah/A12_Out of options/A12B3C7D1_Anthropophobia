I think those words were a dream, something you don't quite catch and then you wonder.  Did I really see that flower fly?  No, of course not.  Did that shadow really just move to catch the cat?  Nah, a trick of the light. Nothing to it.  Did I really hear Laurel say this?  No,  I was just tired.  Maybe.First of all, you have to understand that Laurel has an extremely limited vocabulary.  She will blow "waa, waa" for something to drink, and may even whisper "shaw, shaw" for a shower.  If she is truly in the grip of some emotion (want, happiness, frustration, rage), she will belt out the tune (and occasionally the lyrics) for "peanut, peanut butter."  But as for recognizable, contextual speech, there has been nothing.Yet last night, Laurel and I were cuddling up on the sofa in the loving room* watching tv, and Janet was running around on the floor, scooting her blocks onto a dump truck and then using Modzilla to stomp the truck, the cat, and the floor.  Laurel just stared at her, then at me and then came close to my face and blew into my eyes.   I moved over and Laurel straddled my lap and faced me.  This in itself is odd, because she shies away from faces, rocking carefully and staring at the floor whenever she has to face someone.  But she looked at me and said, "I scared".   Not knowing for sure if she really did speak, and if she did,  if she was actually communicating with me or just repeating something she had heard off the tv or echoing Janet's screaming dolls who were now running away from Modzilla as fast as possible, I asked her, "What are you scared of, Laurel?"Immediately, without any delay whatsoever, she replied, "People". She then laid her head on my shoulder and hugged me *really* tight for about 3 minutes or so.  I stared at her, unable to reply. The tv and Janet's stomping seemed unreal in the silence after this.  The soft tissue of her voice lingered in my mind like a ghost's kiss.  Later that night, I went into her room and saw her lying rigid, eyes wide open.  In the middle of the floor were two of Janet's dolls—poised to devour the Modzilla.  Laurel did not move as I stood in the doorway, watching her staring at the moon.Does this sound familiar to anyone at all?##Higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
