Mom is actually SUPERMOM. No, no one does think that Mom does all this by herself, recovering from the flu, surgery, a bad night, a week of no sleep, or whatever. Because it is after all, your child. And you will do what you need to do.So no one thinks about this at all.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
