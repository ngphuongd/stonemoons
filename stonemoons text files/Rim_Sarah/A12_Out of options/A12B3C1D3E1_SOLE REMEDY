The dictionary of mythology snatches these scraps of words from the lost ages: When reflected in water, the moon is a remedy for nervous hysteria.And then interprets this as the mirror of our subconscious, as the reflected light of spiritual enfoldment.  But this modern patina does nt obscure the truth.The moon's light on the water heals only because the water has given in to the moon.  There is no resistance, therefore there is no pain.  But I cannot help asking, is surrender the only way to end this endless battle?  Or will the surrender itself be an act of unpardonable aggression?___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
