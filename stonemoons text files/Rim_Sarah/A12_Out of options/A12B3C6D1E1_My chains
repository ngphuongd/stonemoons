That is the Office of Civil Rights.  And I actually talked to a human being.   Now is when the fun begins.The desk is piling up with paperwork from the OCR and you are supposed to keep a log of every phone call, every thought, every nuance of every person you contact for your daughter.  This includes the "that's not my department" and the "Well, I'm sorry they referred you to us but we can't help you, you'll have to go back to them" lines. You are supposed to follow up every lead you can, every clue, like a 24 hour gumshoe without any gums in his pocket.Describe each contact.Date of contact:Who did you speak with?What did they say?What agreements were made:        in writing         verballyDescribe each subsequent follow up, including date, person, and action.Describe the last incidentDate of incident:What happened?Who was there?What was the aftermath?My daughter has not been in school for the last eleven months, doesn't that mean anything? No, because you haven't done the paperwork ##higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
