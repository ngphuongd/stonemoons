If she was in a structured program and I could do my errands during the day, she'd be OK.Many of you pointed out that we only have the major blow-outs outside the house. It's so. School had them because they were stupid, like that fool gymnastics coach who felt that it was critical that Laurel not be allowed to re-trace her path back over the balance beam, even when she escalated to beating me for ten minutes (did I forget to tell you guys about that? That was Friday. It's been, like, man, one helluva trippy week.) :  —o It really is only in Jan/Feb when Laurel goes ballistic inside and outside the house. It could be something in the air, or maybe the short rations of sunlight, or the overabundance of carbon monoxide or gravel dust from snow sweepers, or valentines day candy, or anything. At any rate, it is something she just can't handle and it send her sailing over the edge.But I've decided —based on your prompting— to contact the staff at Weiland Elem (the school that thinks she is too advanced to get much good out of their program and besides is too full for her now) and see if any of the teachers or interns can sit on a weekend or in the evening.I'm also going to to contact the alternative high school and see if any of the students there are available. They get off at noon, and they all have to volunteer as part of their grad requirements. A lot of them have late-diagnosed learning disabilities and are familiar with what it is to be left out, and be angry about it, and then blamed for your anger.I'm also going to call Ms. Bradshaw, district coordinator, and ask her to sit for two hours tomorrow so I can go to the doctor to take care of the raging pain in my side and belly.  Or find someone to sit.  Or do anything.  I know she won't, I know she is still trying to get some teacher to help Laurel.  But this is an emergency that can't wait for the other emergency to settle down. We'll see.##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
