NOTE:Moving Laurel into a residential home in another state means:1.)  I would have to relinquish custody so the school can declare her a ward and pay for it2) if I move out to the state, it is no longer the school's problem so they can stop sending her there.If I refuse to accept this, then they can say that I am willfully withholding Laurel from a proper education and can then:1) Work with Social Services to declare me an unfit mother and take custody  (my record at Social Services already shows me as a poor risk factor)2) Put my case on the back burner as a noncompliant mother who has sought "alternative education."  (In other words, if they don't investigate, it doesn't exist. If something happens Ñwell, they simply didn't have the funds to ensure Laurel has a proper education. . . . which is illegal, but believable.)Either way, I get knocked out.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
