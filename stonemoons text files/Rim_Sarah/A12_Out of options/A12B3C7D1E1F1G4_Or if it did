There would be far too many witnesses.Chicago is relatively sane, unlike—say—New York City. If it were La Guardia Airport, no one would see anything.In Chicago, surely someone would go ahead and say "Yeah, I saw the moon swoop down through the tunnel and snatch that lady's kid. Right, the moon had long neon colored hair and was wearing a milky white gown with green stripes. About 6 foot 4, maybe 140-150 pounds or so. Skinny bitch, the moon." Or at the very least, notify the proper authorities. And the moon would never bother the concourses again.##higher##elsewhere##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
