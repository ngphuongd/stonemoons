Here are some clips from the list and my responses. I guess what I'm really afraid of is that the district is looking at residential only—and that for a permanent solution. I wouldn't be adverse to a "summer camp" (or "spring camp") type of thing, if they would teach Laurel and me how to work together, and get Laurel ready for the real world. But that isn't what the school is looking for. Anyway, here are some snippets of ideas:  > It might make you less afraid of having Laurel be away for a while> if the goal there is "A while and to return home whenever possible" >so it isn't an all or nothing scenario.We've had nothing but "diagnostic placements" for the past year and a half. Every time I agree to a "temporary" placement, even if I specify the goal to move quickly and assertively to a less restrictive environment, it's just a step further away from a fair, appropriate arrangement for Laurel. I just can't trust the district anymore. That sounds massively pathetic, but that's how I feel.> Please can I have Isaac's New England Center for Autism school people send you>their material. They have temporary placements—goal is to be out in three months.Sure. Do you need my snail mail address again?> You mentioned your district would even send her elsewhere if>options weren't forthcoming.

There are no aversives you haven't done yourself or wouldn't try.>No painful types at all and I'd be near to check if you weren't.If they have the strength of their convictions, they're probably less likely to whap her upside the head than I am. It's not that I am pro-aversive, or less than a saint ;) it's just that I lack the physical resources to restrain or physically motivate her and I have to do things like shoving her, pulling her by the hair or under the jaw, or locking her in her room just to keep her safe. :  < Now that I re-read that, it sounds really ludicrous; "I had to beat her; she might have gotten hurt!" (Isn't this just what your parents told you as a kid when they spanked you—this hurts me much worse than it does you? ;> )> So maybe this is all babble and I'm just throwing out stuff. But if we all>could send stuff your way on good schools for autism in our areas and please>be okay when I say this, preferably residential just for a while so you can rest>and get some peace and remember the brilliant, funny alter ego like the MTVAre you suggesting that I have lost my sense of humor!? I had no idea it had gone that far! Yeah, folks, I'm open. what do you know? One of my very best friends of whom I'm passionately fond and whose name I can not remember at the moment (please don't take that personally; it's been a long day\\\week\\\\month) sent me a website for Margaret Anderson/Fodor, but it was really a website for a family with a young daughter who has autism, so I don't know how to contact the person she recommends.Somebody said Judevine in St Louis. Anybody got anything on that? If you read cards or crystals, tell me that stuff, too. I need some divine intervention. I can no longer afford to wait for hindsight.>Maybe you could somehow get out of home respite or temporary>hospitalization for Laurel and bring Janet on the train or plane and even>Kodi if need be and visit NECA (Isaac's school) and me.I would love it. I can't imagine what unscheduled alignment of planets would make it possible, but...>In all earnestness (Did I butcher the word?)>even if you never moved or move somewhere else it>might help you see what you want and don't want in a program.Y'know, that is probably the scariest thing that's happening. We are shopping for the McDonalds of programs—just anything we can get. We have completely stopped thinking in terms of evaluating Laurel's needs. When I try to remember what went on at previous IEPs, all the things I talked about are still true and none of them are being addressed. It all seems so distant now...##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
