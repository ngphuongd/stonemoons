To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  Fall 1984This was a long time ago, but sometimes I just know it was only the day before yesterday.  My friend (this could have been Leah, who used to keep the magic we forgot in a hidden corner on the school playground, or maybe it was Susan, who used to be Megalasourus, who was going to be a palentologist because she understood what it was to be frozen in stone) and I went off to Chicago because she had something to show me.I'm not entirely sure when or what we were doing there other than that.##Higher##Further##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
