To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Stuff to worry aboutBeyond the summer looms the great wall, the black unknown. If we can't even decide how to finish off the school year, how are we going to plot out Laurel's future? While all the books are off blithely touting the formative years as the crucial years, the never-say-die years, the only-time-something-can-be-done years, the schools are saying we will deal with it when she is 21.In fact, they even offered to tack on a few weeks of a program when Laurel is 21, to magnanimously make up for what they are refusing her this year. How kind. How thoughtful of them to think that Laurel will make it to 21, or that we will put up with their abuses for another decade and more.But things aren't really any better any place else. Every place has extremely long waiting lists.  The school officials, the doctors, the residential home administrators grasp this knowledge in their craws. Slowly, they squash any thoughts of the future, any dread speculations on the great wall of nothing that looms beyond this school year and billows outward through the rest of our lives.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
