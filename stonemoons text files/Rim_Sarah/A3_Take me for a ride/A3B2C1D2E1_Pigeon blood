The fish turned in the water, their scales shimmering iridescent in the fluorescent light.Laurel stayed far away from the tank—the humming of the lights, I think, hurt her ears.Janet and I watched for a while, fascinated. The pigeon blood one caught our eyes and held them tight. She swam up to the top, light shining through the red-blood of her scales, gasping for air with a thin open mouth.The blood rushed down to feed on the orange-and blue stones, then back to the light with a single minded ferocity.We watched for what must have been forever, our whole beings caught in the flame of her captive blood. ##Higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
