NOTE:While we were waiting on the paperwork, Janet saw some of the same ladies we had seen up on Colfax brought in. She asked in a very loud voice:  "Mommy, how come those ladies were brought in?"I told her they were trying to sell their bodies so they could eat.Janet asked me why they were arrested if all they were trying to do was eat? I told her we weren't going to talk about it right there, but I'd explain it later.She said, still pretty loudly, "Ok. But I don't want to sell my body for food if a policeman can just come up and stop me."I told her to go to sleep. ##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
