And Dad had told me that, when he and Laurel were walking home from the grocery, Laurel wanted to go for a walk on the Canal Trail and Dad wouldn't let her, so Laurel tried to bite Dad and Dad said something like, "Maybe your mom lets you do that, but I won't." ?  Laurel bit him anyway and Dad blamed me for being permissive.It seems Dad omitted a related story. I wouldn't ever have heard it, except Mrs. Macdougal three doors down was talking to Janet and telling her to be careful or she really would call in a kidnapping—just as she nearly had with Dad. I asked Dad about it on the phone (he won't come over unless he absolutely has to—to fix the place, or something) and slowly elicited the meat of the story:  While Laurel was throwing herself down in the street, screaming and snapping at Dad, an elderly couple pulled up in a white Jaguar, opened the passenger door and the guy yelled, "What are you doing to that little girl?" Laurel promptly hopped in the car and buckled up. Dad explained the situation as best he could, and the couple offered to drive them home. Since Laurel was not coming out of the car, Dad accepted.  When they arrived, Laurel held the door handle up so that the automatic door unlock switch wouldn't work. So the fellow got out, came around and tried to open the door with the key, but Laurel wouldn't let him do that either. Dad didn't explain exactly how they got through that, but I can imagine.##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
