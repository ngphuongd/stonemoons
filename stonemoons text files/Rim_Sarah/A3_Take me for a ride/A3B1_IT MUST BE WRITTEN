She rejoiced at the people's happiness—at the splash of the whale's tail, the flick of a cat's eye. xShe knew, however, that nothing lasts forever~the rapture came from nothingness and would go back to nothingness sooner or later. So she vowed to write it all out~to keep it for posterity. She tried first to describe the world in a single word~but the word became too powerful. So she carefully excised it from all memories—even her own~and began again.This time, she wrote on pages* of pure light, using the tips of passing clouds to press the words quickly, quietly into sky. But the words melted as the earth shifted below her, scattering the light. The moon decided to look for something a little more substantial.She tried first one plant, then another. First one ink, then another. First fire, then wood, then rocks. Nothing held the words. The writing was nothing like what she had envisioned. It was merely a shadow of the way things were. But she could not give up.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
