Loud and clear, I am sure. I shall remember it every other Saturday for the next two months, as I have to go in for probation — dragging the girls along with me.  I pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace in return for them dropping the vandalism.  They didn't press the child-abuse suspicions, but it must have been in the report because I got the feeling the judge wants the probation officer to observe us for any further signs of insanity.To sum up the rest of the horrors, Laurel delighted in dumping out the bird seed and water. She managed to do it just as we were leaving, so I didn't notice that the parakeets had a wet cage. The green parakeet developed tracheitis, clicking and wheezing, and I spent $81 at the vet. The kids also managed to break three feeder tubes at $3.50 each. I guess we won't get us any birds anytime soon. Further three of the discus (discusses?  disci?) died, after Janet turned the thermometer down. ("But I thought they might be hot in the water and would want to cool off," she told me. I told her that fish like different environments* than humans.) and I had to replace them at $45 a pop. The lady at Pet World told me I was lucky they were not larger—these fish can run up to $150 to $200 for the pancake-sized fish. Dad came back from his trip around midnight, and came over straight to our house for the key he left with us. I told him, wiping sleep out of my eyes, that he hadn't left one. He pestered, "Are you sure?" and proceeded to look through the house, flipping on lights and clanging around so that Laurel woke up and started howling in her room—as if we would lose something like that on purpose. I told him,"Yes dammit!" As he was telling me not to swear, he looked in his briefcase—where his keys had been for his entire trip. He said nothing. I told him about having to break into his house and about the cops. He said " You should have just called them in the first place."  (This is true, which totally pisses me off.)  "Did you get the window fixed yet?"  When I admitted I had not, he said, "Well, you can take care of it tomorrow."I handed Dad the veterinary paperwork (the doctor's diagnosis, care instructions and the bill). He also said that, as for the green parakeet, "I would have let it die, and hoped it was contagious. I didn't tell you to go to the vet, so I won't pay for that." I told him that was just fine with me. He left. This is a man who volunteers for the library and ships the left-over books from the annual book sale to third world countries. He sponsored an immigrant family from Cameroon. He goes to the Philipines once a year to do surgery in back-woods communities with no medical facilities.  He invests in real estate and gives me a home to live in. But...he is such....a jerk!##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
