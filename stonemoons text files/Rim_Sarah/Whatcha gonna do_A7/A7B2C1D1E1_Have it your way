How could I argue with that?  So the school staff wrote into the behavior program that, if Laurel was aggressive three times in one day, the school would call me and I would have to come pick her up.  The consultants objected:  Laurel would learn to hit to communicate that she wanted to go home.  I objected:  this functionally prevented me from being able to work, since I had to be on call every moment of every day.  And besides, since when was going home with Mom a punishment?  The school staff helpfully suggested that, when I came to take her home, I should make sure the day was not pleasant, so that she would not wish to come home in the future.Last Monday, I got a call at 3p.m  telling me that Laurel was having a very difficult morning and I must come get her right away.  Tuesday, I  got a call at 10 am.  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, I got a call at 9:20 am.  Why the precise time?  This is five minutes after the new behavioral specialist (whom Laurel likes a great deal) leaves.  Dr. Joseph Alfred, EdD. a behavioral specialist the district just employed as a new consultant,  now comes to work with Laurel and teach her staff strategies from 8:30 to 9:15 a.m.  When I returned home from getting Laurel, who was just too agressive to be at school safely, there would be a message on my phone from Dr. Alfred telling me what a great day Laurel was having, what a delightful mood she was in.Is it just my imagination, or is Laurel a fast learner?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
