I got a call from Ivan Newchurch, the new psychiatrist the school assigned to Laurel. He doesn't want to see her, doesn't want to know her background or her signals. He thinks Buspar* is the answer and then told me I wasn't serious about helping Laurel when I wondered about the target symptoms and interactive side effects.   I quoted the Autism Research Institute's summary of parent ratings of behavioral effects of drugs and nutrients, which showed 27 percent of those on Buspar were rated worse for behavior.  I suggested Nystatin instead, a 4 percent rating of worse.He looked out the window while I fumbled through my papers.  The window didn't enthrall him as much as his pencil did, as he twirled it through his fingers and asked where Laurel's father was. Out to lunch is what I wanted to tell him. Just the same as you are now.  There are some moments though, that I do manage to hold onto my shreds of sanity, and for which I am duly grateful."What difference does it make now?" I asked him. My voice was modulated, radiating righteous indignation at the question, but playing the game so he couldn't call me a non team player."No," he said. The pencil found its way back to the desk as he leaned toward me.  "Seriously. Where is the father?" "We separated about six years ago. He is now happily married, a stay-at-home father with two kids. His wife sends me child support payments every other week. Both of the kids speak English," I told him. "No one is from the moon in his new family."  I leaned back in my chair and crossed my legs.  No signals here, pal."And you seem to resent this," he said. "No," I told him. "This is what you seem to want to hear."Then he prescribed some Buspar for me, too.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
