(page 403).  But his next words betray this, as he so fairly points out that he cannot be sure that the parent's attitudes (read mother here) were enough by themselves to cause the problem.  On the next page, he magnanimously declares that "While we believe it [parental attitudes] to be a precipitating factor, this makes it only a necessary but not sufficient condition"   So, to interpret this, we work backwards.   The simplified logic here goes like this:1. Something is wrong with the child2. As children interact with their environment, something is wrong with the environment3. Children interact most with parents.4. Therefore something must be wrong (the necessary condition) with the mother's attitudes and actions.5. This may not be enough to cause the problem, but it is obviously there (Conclusion from 1 - 4)This logic has embedded in it a course of treatment: "...find out what experiences may have caused or contributed to infantile autism" (page 404). The path is quite clear:  "whether we learn to understand infantile autism depends on whether or not we treat autistic children in ways that parallel Freud's" (page 405).   Of course, we can't do that at home, because home is where the problem is.  We take the defective child, subject it to intense psychotherapy.  At the same time,  we take the mother on a pyschoanalytical hunt through her past to determine what went wrong.  Ironically, Bettleheim boasts that this way is the only way to promote hope for if we believe (like some of his colleagues) that autism is an innate disorder, we will give up.  Maybe in the sixties we did give up, we did keep children with spina bifida and cerebral palsy and other physical ailments in institutions.  Things won't get any better, so warehouse them while you still can.  But do we still give up so easily in this more enlightened age?##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
