NOTE:If you put a flea in a jar and screw on the lid, the flea will jump up and bang itself on the lid.  It will jump again, and again discover that, not only can it get no higher, but it will get hurt if it tries.After a while, you can take the lid off the jar.  The flea will continue to jump up just below the lip of the jar.It will starve to death before it dares to jump that little bit further it would take to be free.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
