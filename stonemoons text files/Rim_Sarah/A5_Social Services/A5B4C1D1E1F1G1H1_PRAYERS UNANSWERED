Moon, I have pleaded with youto no avail.The volume of my tears now surpasses any measurement of your pain. My feet bleed in the snowwhere your light no longer lives.My ears will harden into shattered glass unless you surrender~ and leave my child to me.##Moon ##Sarah ___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
