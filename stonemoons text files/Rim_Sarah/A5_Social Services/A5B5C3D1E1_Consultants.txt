I have reviewed the situation  with Ms. Bradshaw, Ms. Scratcherd, and Dr. Morgan.   I believe we agree that given the signs of episodic physiocological hyperarousal, and barring any cardiovascular contraindications, and in the absence of a definitive co-existing medical or psychiatric problem, a trial of Clonidine would probably be a relatively benign, conservative, and possibly effective treatment.However, I should emphasize that we are talking in terms of estimates of relative probablities of sucess here, and that trials of several different medications may be necessary before we arrive at the most efficacious, optimal solution.  What is crucial here is that (1) Each different medication is given a "fair trail" and (2) we are taking very good data to determine the effects of each medication.  By a "fair trail," I am referring to the extremely consistent administration of each medication as prescribed, at a therapeutic level (which may require several increases in dosages) for a minimum period of time as determined by Laurel's physician.  We can set up an appropriate data collection system for you and the school.  This is likely to be a long process involving a period of several months or  years, and patience is critical.  We should avoid discontinuing any medication before a fair trial is  completed, except of course in cases where there are significant and unmistakable negative impacts.  Even in these cases, continue the medication until Laurel's physician and I have consulted.  Please contact me if you have any questions, and please give my regards to Mr. Morgan, the principal, who has been a pleasure to work with.Sincerely Yours,John Alfred, EdD.Licensed Psychologist.cc.
