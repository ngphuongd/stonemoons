And nothing ever frightens me. Except of course the Mafia. But then I am so briliant a strategist that I could probably think circles around them. Of course, you guys are totally lost without a clue about what I am (or am not, as the case may be) talking about. Babysitters, of course. You think Calvin's mother had problems?? At least her babysitter kept coming back (demanding mucho mulah in the process, but nonetheless...) I have a stopwatch to time how long my babysitters last. The shortest time is 2.8 seconds. As my favorite editor-type friend used to say, out of a "slush pile" of 100 babysitters, 2 or 3 are good for an afternoon read, and 1 perhaps out of a 1,000 are good for actually being able to step out of the house and read. Of course, I would have much better things to do with my spare time than read babysitters.The Machievellian part is coming in here now, so watch out. I have started to take Janet and Laurel to the local high school hangout. These are carefully planned trips on days when Laurel is the most amiable. I wash every part of her body, comb out her butter soft blonde hair, get her into a yellow and green dress with a little Peter Pan collar on it, and we go off for a Root Beer Float with Peanut Butter. These words are usually enough to guarantee pretty good behavior as long as the Root Beer Float lasts. Janet is such a cute little talker. She'll charm the fries off of anybody. And so she reels them in while Laurel and I sit quietly. Then while the bait is staring politely at Laurel's porcelain skin, pixie green eyes, and lithe dancing body, I pounce.So, do any babysitting? No late nights, just a couple of Saturday afternoons so I can get some urgent errands done. Yes, as you can guess, Laurel is disabled. She's autistic. She doesn't communicate or live really on the same world we do. But I'll pay you six times the going rate. And I'll stay in the house with you the first time. What do you say?So far, I've gotten one kid who stayed for the entire first day. But refused to come back.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
