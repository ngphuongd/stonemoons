Naturally, this involves expensive psychotherapy for both the mother and child.  With a preverbal, nonresponsive child, and a mother who wants her child to improve (minimum goals, like stop the round the clock screaming, eat, use the toilet), this can take time.  Mothers are cold and remote; children are spoiled.  Mothers are nonresponsive; children shut out the world with self-stimulation or blank, unresponsive staring.The more painful the psychotherapy, the more we know it works.  The more marriages suffer, children suffer, the better--we are getting to the heart of the matter.It took a long time to disprove this without a doubt.  ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
