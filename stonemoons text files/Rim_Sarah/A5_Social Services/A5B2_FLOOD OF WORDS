And the moon thought of everything ~ from the soft brush of moonlight on the tip of a gulls wing to the wide curving lips of the earth as it met her each night. She followed rivers to the sea, chronicling each facet on each water-polished rock, each silvered scale on each slippery hidden minnow. She sent the wind to count, and the wind ruffled through each person's hair, numbering the strands. Her pen marked the curves in each branch, the way each sparrow bounced up and down on its claws ~ first curling to face one way and then with a feather flick facing the other.All these things the moon wrote.  And more. Until the words themselves outnumbered the grains of sands on the beach. Until the moonskin parchment overflowed and the moon's blood flooded the land.##Go back##Press on___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
