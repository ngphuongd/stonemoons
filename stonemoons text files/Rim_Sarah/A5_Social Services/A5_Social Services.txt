Yep, slipped right under everybody's nose. But someone on my autism list saw it and raised holy hell. Rodney says:  >Seems that our favorite SS has struck again. >A closed committee, made up of 12 >professionals and 3 parents, decided that the >new Child Welfare Act should spell out >grievance procedures for those rare individuals >who might question the wisdom of Social >Services. The bill would place all burden of proof >on the parent. They felt this was >eminently fairÑafter all, THEY are the professionals.  >And what would mere parents know >abut their kids.>If this strikes any of you as fishy as it struck me, >now is the time to write Governer Romer. >Today, it's Colorado. Tomorrow, it will be YOUR state.After all of my problems with Social Services, I agree completely with Rodney. But, then, you guys know all about my side of it. Whyncha check out a lawyer or professional or two for their sides? After all, they are so important, they outnumbered the parents on the committee by 4 to 1*!##continue##Delve deeper##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
