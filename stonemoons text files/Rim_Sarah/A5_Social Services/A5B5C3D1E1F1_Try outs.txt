It's a $6.50 per hour, data-entry at home job.  But after driving out to Westminster and taking the typing test and the IQ test and filling out the application, they gave me a list of "policies" that says you can't have children at home while you're working.  Me, being the honest person I am, told the receptionist that my 7 and 9 year olds would be home some of the time. Me, being the simple, straightforward, and dishonest person that I am, did not explain about Laurel's handicap, the times they take her from school, or anything else about the matter.  I figured the simplest explanations were all the receptionist could handle.Apparently, she could not even handle this.  Her face fell about a thousand miles and she inched back in horror that I would come looking for an at home job and actually have kids at the same time.  She said that would disqualify me for the job. And pursed her lips. I told her that, if I could get child care, I wouldn't be working for $6.50 an hour. She said she'd bring it up with the boss and turned back to her paperwork.  I was definitely dismissed.I've been looking for a way to keep food on the table and electricity in the computer so I can have a lifeline to you guys and the autism list.  All I saw yesterday for at-home work was the old "stuff envelopes at home" trick and the even older profession phone sex*.  Obviously I took advantage of neither one.  We'll see.  Something has to turn up after all I can't live my whole life in a catch-22, now can I?G'night.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
