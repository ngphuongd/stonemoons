He admits this:  "Through [Anna, a patient], the phenomenon of the camps which had long occupied much of my personal and theoretical interest became somehow linked with my daily work, the treatment of severly disturbed children."  (page 7*)He is concerned with the loss of humanity that he sees around him—first in the camps, then in the eyes of the lost children (those he pins a label on—infantile autism).  Naturally, the causes of absence are the same.  The souls who fled before their bodies died in camps were fleeing the horrors of men who could kill.  Men to whom caring and love were words they had no time to remember, and to whom other human beings could be vermin to be extinguished. Bruno could not find the souls within the autistic children he treated.  So he deduced that these souls, too had fled.  And whose inhumanity could these innocents have feared?  Only that presented at the mother's breast.  So he knows* that the children's drawings represent the bizarre inhumanity of a mother's missing breast (Figure 8, page 150*).   So he knows that the only way to treat these children is to take them from the obviously demented mothers.  So he knows that he can save the children lost in this safe prosperity as he could not save those lost in the camps.  Thus the SS strikes again.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
