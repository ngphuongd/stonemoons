No. Kindegarten went well.  Laurel learned to play with other kids and to take turns.  She even made a few friends who came over for her birthday party.  It was first grade.  Yes.After Laurel's delightful success in kindegarten, I anticipated a smooth first grade year.  I had not yet developed the art of cynicism. The first grade teacher was wonderful.  She was 62 years old and had been teaching forever because she loved it.  She was animated and gentle and cheerful.  But, she confided in me (in the parking lot Ñnot in the conference room, of course) she had never had an autistic child in her class and didn't want one now."They should have told me a year ago that she would be here so that I could take special classes and learn how to teach her.  But I don't want to spend a year learning how to teach her.  If I did," she said, sealing the logic of her argument, "I'd have been a different kind of teacher all along."I went in to observe.  Laurel ran through that class like a bull in a china shop.  She played with the kids' hair, untied their shoes when they sat in "circle time".  Decorated them with hats from the dress-up area.  The teacher didn't tell her, "No."  After all, the teacher did not know how to say "no" to an autistic child.  She could only teach non-disabled children.  The poor children looked to her for guidance, and she instructed them to ignore her.  So they did.  It was hard, when she was actually touching their feet and faces, but they managed.  Such was the trust this teacher inspired in her charges.I spoke to her about Laurel being frustrated because she could not communicate.  I asked about the computer in the classroom.  I told her Laurel could at least point and click to an activity they were doing or to a color she wanted. She told me, with evident pride, that Laurel was treated just like every other child; she was not allowed any more computer time than anyone else.  I stopped short of asking her how much time each child got in a wheel chair, if one child needed that equipment.The teacher complained about Laurel's disruptive presence to the principal.  The principal spoke to the district special services coordinator, and the special services coordinator engaged an expensive behavioral consultation firm to observe Laurel's program and recommend a plan of action.  The consultants came and took their notes.  They wrote up a report recommending that Laurel remain in the classroom, since that was the only environment in which she could learn the skills for success in the classroom.  The district rejected this recommendation.  They suggested instead that Laurel be moved to a self-contained classroom where two staff people would be assigned to her and only her at all times, and would work intensively on teaching her the skills she would need for "secondary inclusion."   This appears to be a hot buzz-word for "you can have your rights... later."I am trying to remember why I agreed to this.  Most people in the community* would not.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
