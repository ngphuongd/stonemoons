An open letter to Social Services.Congratulations. You win. I've had all the red tape, the bloodied bits of papers and forms I can take. I now ask only that I be allowed to sacrifice my golden girl, my strong silent daughter to your highest altar. After all, this is what you have wanted all along.Like Hecate's night hawks, you swoop down and cast her into your tempest. I know she will never escape from your whirlwind of phone calls which end only in empty shadows beyond the moon.Would you ever be as kind as Artemis, who at least took her sacrifice, Iphegenia, away from the cruel brothers and gave her a hundred palaces in the moon? No. I thought not.##Moon##Sarah___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
