And for that matter, why I hadn't bothered to mow the lawn* all summer long.  He said that my inexcusable laxness was driving down the property values for the whole neighborhood.  And he didn't even want to look inside.  I tried to explain that I was a single mother trying to raise two kids, and one of these kids needed 12 hour a day therapy.  He said that in this day and age that was no excuse.  So I thought I'd let  him see the world from my point of view. Only he wouldn't stay long enough to listen.  So I typed out a morning for him anyway:The dog is barfing in the kitchen because she ate some sugar Laurel sprinkled on the floor. Janet wants to find her pink and purple tee shirt and meanwhile Laurel is putting her hands through the glass windows and clutching the sharp glass edges so that there are glass shards in her hands that go nearly through to the other side.  So you go to the emergency room.  There is no one to watch Janet so off she goes with you, only you forget Smiley, her stuffed rat, and you have to drive the car, make sure Laurel doesn't faint, and explain to Janet that you simply cannot turn the car around and retrieve Smiley and Smiley will be there when you get back.  Laurel is white faced, her eyes slowly widening as she says nothing but holds the hand out in front of her without waving.  You wait in the emergency room and try to comfort Laurel who is now rocking and dripping blood over the emergency room carpet as each rocking motion drives the glass shard deeper into her hand.  You try to keep your eye on Janet who is hopping up and down on one foot, trying to read "Place your insurance information here" and coming close to stabbing her face with a  pencil she has picked up from god knows where.When you get to see the doctor, he asks what happened. You explain that you don't really know, and are not sure how deep the glass shards go.   He puts in stitches without telling Laurel or you what is happening, and Laurel jerks her hand away.  This time you ask a nurse to explains exactly what is going on and she does a great job, so you feel like a jerk for being mad at the doctor.Then you explain to the doctor that Laurel will rip out the stitches before you get to the car. The doctor tells you as he is walking away, "Well, don't let her." "Who do you think is driving?" You ask his back.  He turns back to you, "Can't someone else pick you up?"You rack your brain and go through your address book.  Dad is out of town, the Hardys are on vacation, and that exhausts your entire repetoire of a support network.  There is no one else available.  In the entire Metro Denver phone book, there are no friends to call.  You shake your head.The doctor leaves.You try to wrestle the steering wheel out of your daughter's bound hands.  The wound starts to bleed again and the stitches catch on the gearshaft.  You return to the emergency room and ask for a different doctor.  And go through the whole thing again. Right, well, this is about as far as I can get in the scenario--not that I couldn't go on indefinitely, but Laurel just woke up and I need to make sure she doesn't try to take a shower with her bandaged hands.  Donations to the Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered would be welcome as long as they contain a one-way ticket for me.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
