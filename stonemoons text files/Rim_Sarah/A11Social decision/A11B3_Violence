Seems some girl with long hair asked some boy to hold her hair while she took a drink. Janet, with her short shoulder-length tresses, tried the same thing and promptly punched the guy who laughed at her.  Cost? Three hours in the principal's office with a crayon and coloring book on mediation techniques.Last month, at a birthday party, all the kids were playing croquet. She says that a boy asked her to do something nasty and so she very gently tapped him with the mallet to tell him to stay out of her way. The mother says that Janet actually picked up a croquet mallet and konked him on the head. The boy required three stitches. Cost? No allowance for three months to pay for the copayment insurance and no tv for a month. In January, Janet kicked a girl in the face because she wasn't invited into their game of foursquare. And I could go on with this list. And on.But I only have one question:   why is Janet allowed back in school after her many violent outbursts and Laurel isn't? Is it the degree of violence? Is violence towards kids any better than violence towards adults? Or is it that Janet can talk her way out of it?##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
