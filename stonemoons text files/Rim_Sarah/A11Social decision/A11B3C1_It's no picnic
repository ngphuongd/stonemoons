They're going to a public park, so I guess we can bloody well go if we want to. This has been planned for two weeks and I complied with all her requests to "prepare the class." I talked to the kids. I sent photos. I showed the video. I explained the whole damn thing in fifteen minute intervals for the last week. I even brought them cookies that Janet, Laurel, and I made. I told that thrice-blasted nonteacher this was completely in keeping with the willful nurturing of ignorance leading to fear that I've come to expect from Cattail Elementary. She suggested I bring Laurel in for show and tell one day instead. I told her there was really no point, since this exact kind of prejudice and willful ignorance was precisely why there were so few resources available for children like Laurel. She gave me an "I'm sorry you feel that way". I told her that, if it eased her conscience to think this was all about my attitude, go right ahead, but there were certain realities to having my daughter denied public education for six months out of the year, or to kids being suffocated in institutions as part of their "behavior intervention plan." I told her she obviously didn't want to educate herself; her goal was to revoke her invitation to Laurel to join them for the picnic, and she'd done it. She wanted it to be OK that she'd done that.And damnit, it's not. I was not nice.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
