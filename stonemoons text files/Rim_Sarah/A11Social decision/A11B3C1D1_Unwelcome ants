I got Janet to school with her paper bags of chocolate and marshmallow brownies. She only even ate one tiny corner "to make it even-steven-leven, mommy." Of course, there is no telling if the brownies made it from the car to the classroom in one piece.The dandelions in our yard are in the just-popped-out but not-yet-frizzed state right now, so the yard is shiny with long green grass and bright yellow pretties. Laurel lost herself in a dizzy daze, wandering from flower to petal to flower to torn flower to wind petals for over two hours this morning. After a while Laurel came in and pointed to the car.    She ran into Janet's room, got the barbie doll out, put it in the oven, and put it in the car.  This actually made a good deal of sense to me—Janet gets to have things in the oven and then in the car.  So should Laurel.And I was just burning inside, that constant growl of burnt buttered anger swallowed down with a dollop of cholestrolic frustration. So off we went to Janet's picnic. We stopped by MacDonalds for fries, two chocolate shakes, and a big mac with cheese. Laurel just loves to dip melted cheese into a chocolate shake and lick her hands. The sugar load makes her impossible for a day or two later, but this was a special treat. Or so I told myself, which didn't dampen my heartburn one smidgen bit.So, we get there. We stay at just the right distance—not enough to embarrass Janet, but enough to let the teacher know we are there. Laurel wants to slide down the curly slide. I go with her. She climbs the ladder, sits backwards with her legs hanging over the edges, and goes. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. And the kindergarteners, bless them, whisper to each other, pointing and scuffing their feet. "That's Laurel." "Her mom made the cookies." "Her eyes and ears don't tell her the right stuff." "Let her go first." They mounted guard over the slide, assuring all and sundry that they could have a turn when Laurel got tired. Because, after all, Laurel didn't know about turns. I cringed a bit at this (what mother wouldn't?) but smiled.The teacher said nothing. But called them all in early.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
