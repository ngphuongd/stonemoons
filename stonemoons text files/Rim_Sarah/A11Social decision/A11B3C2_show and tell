NOTE:You never think about these things at the time.But what I should have said, what I meant the dialogue to do was something like this:  SCRIPT FOR THE PERFECT REPARTE:  TEACHER:   Why don't you just bring her in for show and tell one day? I'm sure all the children will find it so educational.SUPERMOM*:   Well, of course my dear. And tell me, just how many other human beings will you have over that day so the children can gawk? Perhaps you'll find room in your heavy schedule for an elephant man? A fat lady? Maybe I can arrange something. Better yet, maybe you'd like a slave auction. Sure, why gape at something for a moment when you can own it forever?TEACHER:   Of all the nerve! I never! If you feel that way about it, we may as well forget the whole thing.SUPERMOM:   Does this mean that Laurel can come to the picnic like any other child? Or are we still separating children into those worthy of picnics and those relegated to show and tell?##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
