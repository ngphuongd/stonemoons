So I will tell you. Before I burst out in tears of rapture.  In smiles, using muscles my face didn't know I had.  YES!!!  Today is more than a red letter day, it is a rainbow, a laurel* wreath, an oscartonygrammypulitzernobel day. Chris and I had been working with Laurel and her comm book all morning.  Just when we were going to quit for lunch, Laurel put a Pepsi icon in the "This is what is going to happen" page and got (drumroll here.....) a Pepsi!  Dah did did dah! yes!! all right!! She took the Pepsi, opened the top, slugged it back like a pro, slammed it on the table in an end zone hike right on the Pepsi icon.While Chris and I were high-fiving, Laurel went off and put in the Muppets Go to New York video. She put her hands on her ears and hummed while we ostentatiously moved the Pepsi icon from the "This is what is going to happen" page to the "This is what happened page."  She didn't look at us, not even out of the corners of her eyes.None the less, never the more, it didn't really matter.   We made contact.  Repeat, Houston, we have contact!  Liftoff!! Chris went home to her long neglected family. Laurel rocked back and forth in front of the tv, mesmerized by Kermit.  I snuggled with Janet for a while, and we giggled over Candyland.After the muppets finished making havoc of New York City, I put a bath/shower icon on the "this is what is going to happen page" and all three of us piled into the shower. I left the spilled water and soap on the floor as our icons of triumph.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
