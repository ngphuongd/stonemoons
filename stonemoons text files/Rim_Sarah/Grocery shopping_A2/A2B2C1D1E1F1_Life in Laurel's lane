As someone said, "the best is yet to be!" The comm book is still working.  Laurel actually gave me the book with the icon for starbursts (a little starburst wrapper) and store on the "This is what is going to happen now" page.   Then she handed me my shoes, coat, wallet, and dog leash.   These, she has evidently decided, are the primary requisites for any venture on the outside.  This is one ritual I can definitely live with!  I got the car keys, but Laurel took them out of my hand. So we walked.  Laurel chose to head for the Safeway about four blocks away.  She even passed up the little gas station that she likes better. She selected a six pack each of Pepsi and Coke, decided against Doritos and chose a box of Fruit Loops. Shock City! If I've ever bought them, it's been years. We don't shop the cereal aisle at Safeway; Chris gets the bulk cereal at Wild Oats and brings it by for us. So this really was some heavy flexibility.Choosing the least crowded aisle (the one with no cashier), Laurel lay down her basket and headed for the candy machines, leaving me to pay for it all. Surprise! I made sure Laurel brought her fanny-pack, and I gave her her allowance before we left the house. I waited, and coached her to take the basket over to the cashier. She wasn't sure exactly what was expected, but after some prompting, she handed over her wallet. (Oh well, close enough.) She had $5 and change and the tab came to $8 and change. Her attention was waning quickly as she moved toward the beckoning colored gums, so I asked the cashier to take off the Pepsi. She did, gave Laurel the change and receipt (and wallet), and her bag. Laurel waited by the gumball machines, her fingers tracing the long slide inside the clear tube. I led her away. She lunged back inside (for the Pepsi? for something else we'd neglected?). I grabbed her and told her she didn't have enough money. She did not appear convinced, but conceded to the inevitability of my irrationality. Several times, she asked me to carry the bag. I declined. She carried it all the way home after that, even offering it to me and snatching it away, offering and snatching. Janet held my hand and we swung up and down, up and down, in tune with Laurel's antics. At home, Laurel put her things away by herself, and sat down to enjoy "The Muppet Movie." She hummed the rainbow song over and over through the whole thing—even before the movie began! I took it as a good sign and hummed right along with her.Ignoring, for the moment, that we were pretty much entirely on Laurel's agenda, and I made almost no demands on her aside from those directly leading to her getting what she wanted, this was a pretty terrific evening. Y'know, no blood and stuff.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
