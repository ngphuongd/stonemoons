She, of course, is "untrained", and unqualified in the sense that she is someone they would hear of through me, rather than through Some Professional Inc. What's the old saying? "The prophet always has to be from out of town." Something like that. Somebody was just saying recently that they lecture in their own and neighboring states, but their family still treats them like they know nothing. Same basic thing. I wrote up a formal suggestion, with workbook exercises, goals, accomplishments, appropriate data collection.  The school board said nothing is stopping me from trying this at this time, but it is still not an approved school curriculum.  So if I follow it, get Laurel used to going to Chris' home and start a routine, I will have to end it the minute we find something else—suitable or unsuitable.  Or I will be willfully withholding Laurel from an education.  Seems I either have to go along with what they want, (which is a nice 1-2 punch* that strips my custody) or move out of state and try in some other district (which would still have her records and I'd still be in this position.) I don't understand their position.  After all, the pressure is really on them to get Laurel some services before they run out of time—and if this is acceptable to Mom, costs them less money, and might just work, what is the problem?   And Marilyn really wants to work with Laurel again.  In any place, in any situation.   Mr. Maddox, the principal, tells me that Marilyn has been complaining about how long the days feel. She says, "If you think working with Laurel is hard, you should try _not_ working with her." Which is odd, now I think of it, because that is precisely what they are trying to back me into.##higher##further##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
