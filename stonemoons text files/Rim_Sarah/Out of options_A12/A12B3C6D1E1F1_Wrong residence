I (silly silly me) thought we were talking about Willard Home in Denver Colorado when we were talking residential placement. After all, that would be the cheapest option and I'd be close enough to partake in all counseling, schooling, etc. etc.Well guess again. Those guys can't put Laurel in a residential home in Denver because that would go against one or another or several or any of or something or other of their bleeping rules. Nooo, they are talking about a home in New Jersey, or something.Flying Laurel out to New Jersey (though Chicago) would be a nightmare. It would be 10 hours of nonstop weirdness. And what if she goes ballistic on the plane and starts biting and hitting me? What's the pilot gonna do, pull up on the brakes, and say "ok lady, you guys hit the road. I think we are half way over Nebraska"??This is so megaweird and probably bitchin illegal too. But it's the laws that got us here in the first place!!P.S. You guys have got to tell me. Am I paranoid? Should I start bitching my head off? How do I respond? I can no longer afford to wait for hindsight.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
