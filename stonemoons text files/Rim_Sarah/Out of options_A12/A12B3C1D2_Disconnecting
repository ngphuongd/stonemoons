I have some positive directions to explore because of you.A couple people suggested the Office of Civil Rights. One of you guys even said that they could do something fast. But I couldn't find them last year, and I have had no better luck in tracking them down this year. I think I need to hire a private eye. Or at least write to that one in the paper. I think she takes cases for free. Last year, the number was disconnected with no forwarding. This year, I called State Department of Education and the people I talked to had no idea what I was talking about. There was some discussion of the "governor's advocate", followed by some calling back and forth across the office, ("What's that lady's name? The one across the street with the brown hair. You know, what's her name." "You mean the one that takes our coffee?" "No, I mean the one who takes those funny cases." ) before they gave me a number that turned out not to be related to education or the government.Many of you wrote in saying that if the bureaucrats can't take it, I need to learn to take Laurel down. Or with suggestions for learning self-defense, crisis management, karate, wrestling. John, thanks for the cordial offer to teach me how to put a half-nelson on Laurel. I appreciate it. I can't get to Florida right now, but if you can come here, I can put you up. (Probably not in a wrestling hold though ;) )I can take Laurel down ok. We can stay there indefinitely if we just stay there indefinitely, if you know what I mean. If we have to move (like, we are at the curb of Yale and Monaco, we are in the middle of Safeway's only exit, we are on the playground and the other kids and moms are getting really freaked), it gets tricky. She sometimes takes upwards of ten minutes to de-escalate.Dungarvin, Inc., teaches Mandt humane restraint techniques. I called them last summer and left a message and we never connected. Of course, I'd have to take Laurel with me, since I have no respite.These are other things on my "to do" list.##higher##elsewhere##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
