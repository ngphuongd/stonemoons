It is said that to play it is to go insane.Mozart, of course, could not resist and wrote a quintet for it.Oboe, viola, and cello flirting as always with luna and some extra bubbles for the flute.Glass moistened at the rim and spun in orbits of overtones.The timbre may be what invokes the moon so often. The oboe only makes one a bit strange, not totally possessed.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
