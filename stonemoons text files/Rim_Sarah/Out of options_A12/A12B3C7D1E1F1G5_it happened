To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  Fall 1984It did happen. I have the ticket stub somewhere, probably in with the self-generating bunny dust under the refrigerator. But what I'm wondering about now is whether it happened to me or to Laurel or to someone else entirely.If it had been Laurel, then all that stuff about weed wouldn't be necessary. If it had been anyone else, I'd have to tell you to do the Columbian gold, definitely with the seeds. Or else home grown, the kind you spray with sugar water just before you cut it.But would it happen again if I took Laurel to New Jersey? And what am I afraid of?The idea that the concourse between A and B in Chicago O'Hare Airport is close enough to the moon that Laurel could be snatched up is ludicrous and just shows I haven't had enough sleep in way too long.##Higher##Further##Back##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
