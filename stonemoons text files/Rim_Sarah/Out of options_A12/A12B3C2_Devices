So she doesn't run away any more. That's an aversive, but it beats her getting lost, or hit by a car or I don't want to think what else because I let her out of my sight for a minute. And I'll confess I've grabbed her by the hair to get her to loose her jaws clenched on my arm. And I've smacked her back a fraction of a percentage of the times she's hit me. (Some of you are offended that I would hit my daughter, and some of you think I ought to do it a lot more. And you're both right.)I had told the school about this in the last meeting, as another suggestion for keeping Laurel in her classroom there.  It seemed like a reasonable idea to me, but Carrie and Marilyn's faces just went white and apparently Mr. Maddox informed Social Services.   Now I've got a letter on nice official letterhead informing me of the situation (which I think I already knew, thank you very much) and that some minor official or major potentate  thinks that this is far too much force than necessary to restrain the child.  And the guy with the scrawl I can't read thinks that the child is unrestrainable and poses a definite threat to the neighborhood and community.  (I wonder, has Mrs. Macdougal finally called and complained?  And if so, what did she say and how did it get through the ranks?)Anyway, they want me to appear on charges of child abuse stemming from the door aversive, and they want to know how I am going to keep Laurel from terrorizing the neighborhood.  This on the same piece of paper mind you.  Granted, they did separate the two thoughts with a paragraph and a five space indent, but still..So they want to know what I intend to do about that.  And will I reply in triplicate to three separate offices by Monday the 28th to arrange for an appointment for counseling? Such is parenthood. ##higher##elsewhere##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
