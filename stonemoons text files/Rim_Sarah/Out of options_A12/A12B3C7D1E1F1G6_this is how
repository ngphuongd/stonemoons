To:  Sarah MurphyFrom:  SarahSubject:  Memory filesDateLine:  Fall 1984All I can remember from that tunnelbetween concourses is the slowly changing, every-flashing lines of neon, mirrored into infinity from the ceiling.I knew then that if the moon had hairit would be these neon strands, so infinitely reflected in the mirrored ceiling stained silverlike the clouds baskingin the moon's stolen light.If the moon had a voice,then it would be these reed tonesgrowing into the music flowingfar from the light.##Higher##Further##Back##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
