This is definitely one of those times when I hope that this message finds you in much better shape than it left me.  Hope your holiday preparations are going well, festivities and joyous celebrations planned and executed with all deliberate joy and goodwill of the season.As for this home front, things are a bit warped.  I think we will put off celebrating anything for a while, and wait until Laurel calms down a wee bit.   Laurel has been moody all day (?)  all week! all month!  Winter break* confuses Laurel—she has dressed herself, grabbed her books, and stood waiting for the bus every day this week.  She will wait on the corner for as long as I let her and then pushes away as I lead her inside.Stomping her foot and shaking her whole body, she will retreat to a corner and mutter.  I explained that this was Winter break, that it was temporary and she would be going back to school soon.  Janet tried to play school with her, going over the workbooks and giving out starbursts for just being there.   I dragged out the materials we had had so much luck with this summer and tried to get Laurel interested in putting the banana card over the banana, the walrus card over the stuffed walrus.  None of this worked.  Laurel just put her hands over her ears and hummed at us.  Even the muppets have lost their appeal.This morning, I tried one more time to get her interested in her comm book.  I took out the paper and cut out icons (a Christmas tree and a pine wreath) that I thought she might like.  Something new, something different.  This was, of course, a massive mistake.  When I put the icons on the "This is what is going to happen now" page, Laurel freaked. Her eyes grew big, her mouth puckered in on itself, and she started to rock.Needless to say, we did not go out for a tree.  Janet had already brought out the ornaments, and Laurel took each ornament and carefully smashed it against the window.   I tried to stop her, holding her in my arms and pressing against her belly.  She wriggled free and started her keening screaming.  I tried to tie her down, but she struggled too hard for me to get a good grip and leave a hand free to restrain her.  Janet grabbed the comm book and shoved it at Laurel.  WIth  her hand covered in blood and glass shards,  Laurel  grabbed the comm book from my hands and started tearing it.  Blood covered every bit of the pages.  When she found she could not tear the fabric and velcro of the book itself, she pushed me aside, wrenched open my desk, and pulled out the scissors.  Her hands were still full of glass shards, but she stabbed the book with the scissors until nothing was left but rags.Then she ran into her room and locked the door.  I could still hear her wailing hours later, her hands still pounding on the door.I stayed on the other side of the door for those hours, slumped over.  There was nothing else I could do.  She came out about a half hour ago.  The skin on her hands was shredded, and there were several long bruises on her arm. But the blood had dried.  We took a shower together and I cleaned up as much of the wounds as I could.  I thought about going in to the emergency room, but I don't think either of us can handle that at this point. ##Higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
