I don't know if she will take her money-green Jaguar and just go directly to the airport, or if she will come back and act as if nothing had happened. If she goes to the airport, will she at least drop a postcard? Something with those naked little kids on the ski slope looking back at you through dark, too old sunglasses, with a scrawl on the back "Wonderful visit, hope to see you soon?" or "Come out to California after you've placed the child" (or will she actually say, dumped the kid?) Will it end with a "love and kisses" and a row of x's at the bottom, or will she even have time for that, waiting for her plane in the smoker's lounge, sipping her third vodka and coke?With my mother, you never know. Which is probably, as some shrink or other, would say, the cause of this whole mess. Not hysterics, not the moon madness we bleed through each month. Just the fact that in my family at least, abandonment is a regular thing.Like the times she would walk out on me and my little sister Kelly. But you guys don't want to hear about that right now.So I will wish you all a very merry Christmas, and thank you for stopping into cyberspace and sending cards and mints and the goodies. Thanks guys, for being here.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
