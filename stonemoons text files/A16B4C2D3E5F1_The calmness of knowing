To relate like human beings, in the same universe, if not in the same house.  I massaged his back, reminded him of the touches we shared.  Then I tried to share my soul.  I dreamt I was auditioning for a place in his life, and I had to sing a song that would move him to tears before he would open up his soul and let me in.  Grabbing a guitar and this song from the air around me, I began crooning this and he cried.  Not able to fulfill the import of his tears, he disappeared in a shaft of moonlight.   I woke up, the song burnt into my mind.  His body was still there on the other side of the bed.  But I could not see his soul.Lost VoicesI know you're thinking 'bout a working dayI know you're bustin' it to make your wayAnd you're trying to take care of me.I know you're very good at what you know,I know that everybody tells you so,But there's something you don't see.Chorus:Deep down inside there's a place I can hideThat is not meant for anyone else.I don't care if it is wrong,  when the music is strong.This is something I do for myself.You know it's easy laying out your handOnly loving what you understandAnd pretending to be strong.It's harder stepping out of what you know;Loving even when you're letting goKnowing you can't buy my song.I found your safety but I lost my voice.If I could go back, would I make that choice?Would I still want to belong?Our bodies know each other but our soulsGot lost in credit cards* and career goalsAnd there's no time for my song.Who were you before the baby came?You had a different face, a different name.Do you miss the you that's gone?I can't be what you want,A shadow in this house I hauntAnd I can't find the strength to pretend.(©Clarsa McElhaney*)After I wrote this, I knew it was too late.#Higher#Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
