Carrie hemmed and hawwed about it. She said she had resolved years ago never to use a time out room again. We talked about it being used just to keep them safe, and it being not a punishment, but a place where Laurel could be kept safe while she calms down. She likes to be alone, and she usually recovers from upset best that way. Carrie rolled her eyes and said, sarcastically, "Great. We'll paint balloons and stick CDs on the walls . . ." Ms. Bradshaw, the district special ed coordinator said, "We'll call it Laurel's safe place." Carrie said, "Dress it up and call it anything you want. It's still a time-out room. But I can't see any better alternative."The vice-principal and the district head said they'd take care of it between them; there are requirements in the district, such as that the door must have a window or peep hole. I insisted that it have adequate ventilation.  They also said they'd need paperwork getting my OK, and that I could stipulate that only Carrie and Marilyn are allowed to put Laurel in there. (And Laurel, I suppose.) So that a sub or other staff would be unable to use it.This makes sense to me. Of course, there aren't any subs for Laurel. If Carrie or Marilyn are ill and can't come to school, the school simply calls me and tells me to pick up Laurel. This happens about once a week or so right now, so I still can't actually get a steady job or earn money where people expect me to show up. Ah well. Such is the life of an isolated mother and child. In the big city.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
