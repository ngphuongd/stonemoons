She washed the small body—the cold had rushed into the joints so soon after the heat of the fever that the old woman shivered and could not stop her own shaking.Then she buried her daughter on the moonless night, leaving new honey and old wineskins for the moon's supper. She bent over a dark pond, fringed with cattails. Moaned to the moon goddess, baring her wrinkled, sagging breasts to the darkened stars. Begged the moon to give back her daughter, her only comfort in the dark rag poverty of the forest. The moon came to her, carrying a torch with five flames and a scrouge painted in dusk red ochres. "You cannot have your daughter," she told the old woman. "For your daughter has always been mine. But you may have anything else you desire."The old woman fell to her knees, clutching the thin pale roots of the cattails. "Then let me be with you, so I can just glimpse her on the brink of a new moon," the old woman pleaded.The moon smiled. Cold swept swiftly through the old woman's outstretched arms.A woodcutter found her the next day, with blood fever marks staining her lips, splitting them into a frozen smile.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
