Someone is explaining something again about risks and ordering something stat or stet.  Stet is to stay the same, I tell them.  I don't want to stay the same.  I want my girls.  I think in short bursts, then nothing.The dark mask comes down over my eyes and into my mouth. I want to say one last thing, something so important, something they need to understand before they cut into me. I cannot draw in enough breath to support my body.  Hands hold me down while I struggle to escape the mask.Slowly, I forget what it was I needed to say.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
