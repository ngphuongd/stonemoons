She knows what badges she wants to earn—has a list on her wall with dates and everything.  Suzie's mother, Karen, is the den mother and has the ten little girls all ecstatic over her agendas.  Already, they have learned the Tennesee waltz, tried the scottish polka*, had a lemonade sale, and made yarn octopi and god's eyes*. They have plans for learning Japanese flower arranging, going to the water works to see how pipes fit together, and riding with a policeman for a day.   Janet says that Laurel would want to go into Girl Scouts.  She brings home some yellow and green yarn and two glued together popsicle sticks to show Laurel how to make her very own god's eye.  She takes Laurel's hand in hers and together they weave the yarn under and over, under and over. Laurel actually sits still for this for ten minutes, and snatches the half-finished god's eye out of Janet's hands.  Then she sits in the middle of the kitchen floor, trying to spin it.  Janet and I watch open mouthed as she does get a few turns from it.  "See, I told you she wanted to join the Girl Scouts."  Janet said triumphantly. Just where she made this brilliant logic leap is beyond my meager analytical skills.  So I said I'd see what I could do.I called up Karen first, and she hemmed and hawed.  I climbed the phone tree, going after one person, then another, doubling back occasionally (Call Mrs X?  But Mrs. X said to call YOU!).  After going up and down the alphabet a couple of times, I reached a kindly Mrs.  P (for Patterson).  She said that while no troop would take Laurel, we could make an official troop of one for her.  We would Laurel-ize the criteria for badges and for trips.  She could join other troops as a guest—where appropriate, where all children and their mothers agree in advance, where it would not pose any threat to anyone, where etc. where etc. So now Laurel is the Girl Scout Troop 001.  (We tried to make it 007, but that was already taken.)  I have the paperwork and everything all finished.  We held our first meeting, but Laurel was much more interested in the cd she was holding than the badges.  We have to find some badges that really shine.  Or that look like, act like, and taste like orange starburst candy.  Then maybe she'll notice.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
