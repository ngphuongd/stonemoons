 IntelliType FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE.  DATE:  3/28/97BEGIN TIME:  19:49END TIME:  20:23FACILITATOR:  SarahWhere the thing is not is just as important as where the thing is. Water on skin chooses where it will be very carefully. It beads into itself, drowning the light and bringing the light down on the walls of the shower where it is safe.The moon is lurking under the doorway, testing her long cool strands of light on the threads of the carpet.Water will drown the voice of the moon so the carpet cannot hear it. Water must keep flowing through the carpet.Do not stop it.  Let it work.No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
