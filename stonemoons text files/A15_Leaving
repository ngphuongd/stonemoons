Well, why am I writing this when all of you knew what was coming anyway? Because I have to, that's why. I have to tell you how it happened for me.  Laurel tugs at my hand. She is in a good mood today. She squints up at the sun, laughing.  It's a hot day, a promise that summer is coming soon.  But we don't notice the sweat on her brow.  We just watch as she whirls around on the grass, her yellow and green gypsy skirts flying out from her like some alien flower. We stop walking, entranced, I guess, or just wondering whether to take off and tackle her before she starts running. Laurel stops whirling and stalks us from behind.  We turn to her, noting the spots in her eyes now staring wide into the sun.  I can almost see the fairy wings she types about.  Her throat glistens in the light.  I try to walk back to her, but Marilyn gets there first and pushes behind her, herding her in.We walk up to the red brick cottage where she'll stay (why are all these places that damned red brick? Why couldn't it be pink or purple or something, not the color of dried blood?).  The windows are latched shut.  A tiny blonde girl in a long blue-green turtleneck stares from the window closest to the door.  I stare back. She doesn't move.Carrie and Marilyn each take one hand and lead her inside. The heavy door closes behind them with a metal "Ka-chunk".  (Why does a cottage have a metal door?  And why are the locks so shiny in the noon sun?) She does not turn and watch me leave her here.##delve deeper___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
