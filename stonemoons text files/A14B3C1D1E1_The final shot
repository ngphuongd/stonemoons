Unlike the others, she explained just exactly where she was going:  but not why. Someone out in Orange County had come all the way to Denver looking for a lady, she said. He found one. And I am definitely not going to let this fish get away, she said. "Best of luck," I told her. Kelly asked her when we were moving to California. "You're not," she replied. "You're going to stay with your Aunt Florence in Cripple Creek. Mountain air will do you both some good.""We'll be better off without you," I told her."I know," she said.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
