You don't know how much they mean to me. Again, thanks, one and all.Anyway, a lot of you want the district's number so you can call and take action. It's in the Denver phone book under Cattail Creek School District. But this could be any district, any place. So I don't know if yelling at the district will do any good. At this point though, it is kind of hard to care if they get yelled at or not. If ya know what I mean <;x>I was going to say something about being constructive, or. . . I dunno. I keep thinking about the mother in France who murdered her adult autistic daughter (at her daughter's request) and the way the parents kept talking about how wonderful all the professionals had been. You are all familiar with my constant second-guessing myself:  Am I being too demanding? Am I being a pushover? Ms. Bradshaw has a great reputation for being 100% for the kids. She's told me she loses sleep over this case. She gave me a cash settlement for the time I lost from work last academic year, and for driving Laurel to summer school when they couldn't arrange transportation. They've spent tons of money on Laurel. And she is looking. Not fast enough for me, obviously, nor are they finding the people they need. And I have checked the papers and not seen any advertisements — but maybe they're advertising at the colleges or some other way that I don't see. Or maybe—and maybe I just don't want to see it—they've decided that residential placement is THE only answer. Maybe they really aren't following up any other leads. Maybe they are just waiting for an opening—any opening. (I guess, and this is the really scary part, that that is what I would be doing if I were them).I don't want to create something adversarial. But this is not good enough. And my paranoia* is growing by leaps and bounds every second that I don't hear from these guys. Whaddya all think? If Ms. Bradshaw's doing all she can, then I don't want to come down on her with my paranoid fantasies. I mean, this situation isn't terribly reinforcing for her as it is. Let me know if you think I'm really paranoid, ok? I just can't see it for myself right now.I'm not sane yet, but I'm closer to it than I was. You guys are great. That's so weak. Sorry. I'll say something profound later. Maybe much later.##higher##further##back##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
