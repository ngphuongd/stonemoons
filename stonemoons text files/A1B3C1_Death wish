And in that second, I could see Laurel's funeral.  Could feel the relief.  There would be time for a shower, time for a sit down meal, time to read more than 2 pages of a book.  I could work, get some money in a retirement account, send Janet to college.  In short, a life like anyone else's—a life which seemed so far out of reach now.  And all I had to do to get it was give into the throbbing pain and simply not get up.I closed my eyes against the guilt this brought out.  This was surely the right thing to do. Surely no one would have to suffer anymore.I cried as if she were already dead.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
