I've actually been reading it for the past month or so.  When I can.  I picked it up because of the title, Children with Emerald Eyes:   Histories of Extraordinary Boys and Girls. I would like to think that Laurel is not alone, that the emerald green of her eyes means something to someone. Any way, before I get too awfully maudlin, I wanted to show you what I found on page 197. The author has spent the time up till now teaching autistic and developmentally disabled kids, and has just taken one, Danny, home for a month.  Here is her report back:  "Then I learned to have respect for the parents of such children. To live with these kids is at times beyond the realm of imagination. It is at times a test of human endurance. And at times a ripping of one's guts, a tearing of one's frazzled nerves. It was then that I learned, at least a tiny bit, what the parents of these children go through.It was then I learned what it means not to have a life of one's own.It was then that I learned some compassion for parents. It was then that I learned some humility.And for that I shall always be grateful to Danny and his parents." (page 197)See?? Someone understands at least a little. But only because she had to care for Danny (an autistic boy—or rather "a whirly fleeting thing that was a boy" (p. 158)). She had only a month of this never-ending-life-sucking mania, and she wrote that. Cool. Wonder what I would write if I could have time to write.Because I am such a nice person (and I may want to find this book again: it is a library book and I wouldn't mind it being on my shelf, hint, hint) here is the other info you might need:  Mira Rothenberg, 1960, 1977 The Dial Press, New York.1 Dag Hammerskold PlazaNew York, NY 10017##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
