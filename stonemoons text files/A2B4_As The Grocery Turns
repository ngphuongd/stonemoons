She is still deftly dodging carts, defiantly overturning the newspaper stands, even kicking at the new coke machines and old penny gumball machines (now demanding 25 cents) and trying to squirm out of my arms, kick my shins, and bite me at the same time. I kept thinking of the Taz monster on tv, the whirlwind of destruction, the abu jinn of the arabian mythos. Strange where one tends to go in those split seconds.One of the ladies at the customer service and video checkout counter looked at Laurel screaming all over the place. Gazed slowly at my bleeding arms. Solemnly offered me a tissue.Naturally, I couldn't take it, my arms filled with hysterical child. She didn't walk out from the counter with her offering.  Of course not. Rather, she carefully looked at me, looked at the tissue, and said, "No dear, you probably need more than this."    And walked off to help some other customer.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
