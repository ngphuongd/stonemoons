You are down in the basement commons room watching Star Trek reruns because everyone in Libby Hall, where you live, insists on watching Three's Company. He comes in too, shy, tall, blond hair with just a hint of a down moustache. Acne on his forehead, but combed over with lanks of extra hair. At first, you just talk about the show. Share tidbits. Encourage each other to GET A LIFE PEOPLE, just like William Shatner has one. Right.This talk of course, segues. He's premed, majoring in chemistry with a minor in linguistics because they like that human interest stuff. You compare Chomsky to acid, stumble over fricatives, and then leave the subject entirely. He knows nothing about early preCambrian history, which you tease is your major. But it isn't really. Just English. And so you talk a bit about Adrienne Rich and skiing, Borges and hangliding, Emily Dickinson and dorm food.These conversations take longer than the shows. So you go out for midnight coffees at Penny Lane in his beat up Ford station wagon ("My mother's," he says. You nod.).  Listen to bad poetry and beatniks droning on about something you cannot possibly fathom—or want to. This turns to other things, and later you find yourself in his dorm room, learning his roommate's schedule, fingering the glass prisms he has strung up across the whole of the window, trying to impress him.But the prisms are genuine lead Austrian glass, and both of you can see right through them.##Higher##Lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
