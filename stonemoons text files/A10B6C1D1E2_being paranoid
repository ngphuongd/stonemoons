NOTE:Is it really that people want to shut Laurel away and throw away the key?  Is it that they stare because they don't know what else to do or that they are truly affronted by Laurel's existence?I don't know, does this happen to other people or am I just me?##back__________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
