NOTE:A few minutes later, another nurse came in.  By this time, my IV'd arm was strapped to the guard rail, my left breast was showing, and I was shivering violently.   I told her I was cold, and she brought out warm blankets from the closet.  As she tucked me in, she asked if there was anyone I could call—the doctor would like to make sure I had someone around for the next few days in case I lost more blood.  She busied herself with injecting a new bottle into the IV.I told her no.While the cold liquid of the anesthetic hit my veins, she asked me, "Well, what are you going to do if you faint?"I told her that if I fainted and died, someone else would definitely have to clean up the house.She laughed and shook her head.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
