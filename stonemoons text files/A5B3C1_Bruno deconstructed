I certainly am not going to give this in a conference or to the AMA, so it is not vetted.  But so what?  I can deconstruct Bruno pretty easily.  Much more easily than I can construct him.First off, why does he assume that these illnesses are caused by an emotive disorder?  This is akin to assuming that quadruplegics or Down's syndrome or any number of ailments are caused by our emotions.  And while I know some people think they are, I think we have enough evidence that if you treat the physical body you can cure or prevent the physical ailments (look at polio, smallpox, etc.)Second, why is it the mother's fault?  What happened to the other members of the family who were in the same environment and who did not develop autism?  Third,  why draw the parallel between the averted gaze of an autistic child and the averted gaze of a concentration camp prisoner?  Or a parallel between "the disregard of reality and the withdrawal into fantasy life" (page 67*).  This is obviously a personal inference:  Bruno saw both, and therefore both were related.   The idea that autistic children see too much of the world—that sounds, sights, taste, smell are too overwhelming as their organs are too highly developed is just as valid  (and this is corroborated by accounts from "high functioning" autistic people).  Of course, beating up on Bruno is easy to do.  We all do it.  We have to to keep our sanity.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
