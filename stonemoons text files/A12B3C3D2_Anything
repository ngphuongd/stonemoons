I have calls in to the governor's office, the Department of Education, PEAK parent center, the Legal Center...Mind you, any arrangement we're now talking about pertains to the academic year which ends in seven weeks. Summer school and beyond? We have not begun to address these things.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
