It seeps into my body, draping itself sensously around my belly like a diaphonous robe. It settles softly, caressing me, probing for its point of entry.Finding the broken spaces on my skin, the pain cinches itself into a wire-bound, scarlet silk corset, the kind with the holes taken out to leave room for the nipple clamps and chains. It knows how to ring my body in fire.I have become its slave. The only key I hold is my words, repeated now until the fabric of the sound tears with repetition:  Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
