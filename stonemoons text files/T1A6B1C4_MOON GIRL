She searched for someone to share it with, someone to take her place when she was gone. Finding no suitable young girl in the village, she walked under the moon. Strewing the finest, strongest herbs she could find into a circle, she called the moon. She bathed in moonlight, letting the light find her. She chanted to the moon beams, begged them to grant her last wish:  I thirst for company, someone I can share my old years with. Give me a young girl, some one fair to see. Grant me someone who can see far and think clearly. And I will name her after you, the fairest of the sky. The moon laughed when she heard the tale. "I do not want your namings*," she cried. "But I will give you what you ask for." After far too many more moons to remember, the girl came. Her hair was long spun copper, her eyes buttered gold, her limbs lithe and strong. Her beauty made the trees bow to her, the ground offer up to her any number of precious stones. Some swore the girl had sailed down the moon's light. The old woman smiled and said that she had seen the girl's soul, that the girl could indeed see far and think clearly. But when the girl tried to speak, only the harsh braying of donkeys emerged. Spittle flew from the edges of her mouth.Everyone then said the woman had finally gone mad under the moon, for the girl could not speak and was obviously an idiot.When I think of this, I wonder what I asked for under the moon, what I promised to name my child after. Sometimes, I spin the story out a bit longer, weaving the memory of an old woman showing the girl all the stores of her knowledge, hoarding it away from the bitter shunning of the villagers.___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
