To:   mmarconi@netcom.com, grahambell@aol.com, grever@ibr8smtp...From:   Sarah Date:  9/30/96Ms. Peggy Somebody or Other up at Social Services called wanting to know why Laurel had not been in school from November 10 to January 19th of last year. Now I want you to note that this is an entire year later and the SS neglected to say anything about this last year when I called. Apparently, they don't have any records of my calling the Colorado Department of Education every single day of those 2 months. Even the Office of Civil Rights doesn't have records of bouncing me back and forth.She briskly implied that this was neglect on my part and really didn't want to hang around on the phone for an answer. So I told her that I yanked Laurel when I discovered that they had her in that storage closet 6.5 hours a day, with untrained staff, doing peg boards and playing with shaving cream. She thought that this was a very unprofessional thing for "Mom" to do and that if I couldn't cooperate with the school board, they really shouldn't cooperate with me.I asked her if she had been listening. She said she had been. Every word.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
