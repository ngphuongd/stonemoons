NOTE:Laurel was not born in a kind, gentle way.   Laurel screamed her arrival a full 37 hours before she came.  The labor pains ceased to become separate events and merged with the facts that he was busy taking exams and could not be there,  that the doctor was in a lecture about the importance of natural childbirth and could not be there, and did I have my insurance forms with me?Laurel was not born in a natural way.  After the hours of labor,  hours of the lung-bursting breathing exercises and urges to push, I felt nothing. The doctor put me out and took over the contractions himself.Somehow, we both survived that night.##back___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
