Bones know. 

You press everything inside them until the weight devours all the secret places. You know then there are no more calcium crannies to hide what you cannot face. The bones cannot hold your atoms in place any longer, and they shatter under the weight of what you have never said. 

Their shards pick at your skin late at night, saying we knew. We knew.
