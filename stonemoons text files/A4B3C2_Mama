But I hold it to my face like the beloved edge of a soft blanket, worn thin with companionship.My dad, who doesn't talk much (he prides himself on being "stoic"), suggested that Laurel's behavior problems (like her grandmother and probably mother) are largely due to her being spoiled. He thinks I let Laurel get away with more than I would an ordinary kid, because she's disabled. The fact of the matter is that decades of research have shown that paying attention to undesirable behaviors reinforces them. Punishment may seem like the reasonable thing to do, but really, it just makes the behaviors more durable, and increases the child's tolerance of punishment. Especially in a case where the child simply has no other way of expressing needs, punishing bad behaviors quickly erodes the child's self-esteem (The child sees it as, "You have no right to protect yourself. You have no right to express yourself.") which leads to a host of other problems, such as mistrust, SIBs (self-injurious behaviors), low frustration tolerance, and unwillingness to try new things. I can point you to Lovaas or Durand or any number of other respected scientists to back that up. So it's not like I haven't done my homework. OTOH, I can hardly say that I'm doing an acceptable job, in light of her continued behavior problems, so I can't afford to dismiss anybody's suggestions out of hand. And besides, he's my dad; any criticism from him makes me feel like a stupid six year old playing at grown-up. (Which makes sense, because when they divorced when I was six, he said to me, "So now you're the grown up in the family. Behave like one!")So, we're over at Dad's house a couple of years ago, and Laurel thwumps Janet over the head with her fist. I can't remember now just why. And Dad gives me this wordless look that translates in my manual to, "I'm not going to get involved, but you're handling this all wrong." I firmly order Laurel to sit down on the sofa. I make sure Janet is OK, then head over to give Laurel a talking to. She looks into my grim face and says, "Mama." I gather her into my arms and say, "Yes. Mama." and rock her. Dad says, "Got out of that one." With fire in my heart, I say, "Damn right. I've been seven years to hear that and I deserve it!" ##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
