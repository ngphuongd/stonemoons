But she still goes after them so fiercely that they are not safe. Today Laurel was attacking her teachers and they left the room, one holding each of the two doors. She opened a window, went outside and came 'round, laughing. Isolating Laurel further would involve identifying another room, another school, an institution or other place without windows, where she could be kept away from people she might hurt, and she wouldn't be able to get out. Her teachers object to the idea of moving her. They say they are already in as safe an environment as they could be in given the circumstances. And more time out rooms or windowless prisons would not help matters.For once, I agree with them. Which still doesn't leave open many options.##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
