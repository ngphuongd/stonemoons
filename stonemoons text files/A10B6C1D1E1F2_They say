He/She/It went on to say that this was so obvious, because these parents would do things like laugh hysterically into answering machines, pull their kids out of school for no reason whatsoever, and etc. and etc. This would have probably gone on for a long time, but we were all so busy typing in ROTFL ROTFL ROTFL* as fast as our giggling fingers would carry us that we paid him/her/it no mind.Every one knows it is the other way around. Handicapped kids come with your choice of menus:   either take the world seriously and crack up from the insanity juxtaposed upon reality or develop an extremely macabre sense of humor. Unfortunately, every example of humor that struck us as funny struck him/her/it as extremely weird.Sigh. Some days you can't win for losing. (Or doesn't anyone else find that remotely funny?)##higher##lower___________________Sarah/ Moon/ Laurel___________________
