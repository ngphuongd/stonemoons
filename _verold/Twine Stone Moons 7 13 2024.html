The carpet is talking to the moon. Their voices linger under the bed in the dark. The moon hides under the carpet in the day. 

The slivers of the moon cut the flesh of the feet so the feet cannot walk. The slivers infect the feet, drawing quick silver blood into the light.

The moon dances, carving patterns of pain on the feet.

Dandelion stems break open when the fingernails cut them. The blood of the dandelion is moon white, with pale, sharp cloud colors hidden inside. The dandelion skin still stays green under my hands when it is cut.

When the skin of the moon breaks, where does the flesh go?

The mind of the moon is broken. It is worn out and the threads of the moon are tired. 

I pull the carpet threads to reach the moon.

But I do not find her.

The heat of the stove grows slowly. The arms feed dry husks of spaghetti into the slow bubbles of water. Soon the water will turn the crisp dryness to thin rubber. The mouth waits.

The mouth understands the need to wait for the water to change the spaghetti.

The carpet understands the need of the moon to wait.

The grass outside starts to grow thick in the sunlight, weaving patterns of light and shade while the eyes stay still, watching.

The eyes stay very still, like the tigers behind the tv. Wait for the prey to move first.

But they do not catch the pattern moving.

They do not find the moon in the pale stalks under the new sharp grass.

The threads of the carpet weave new cloud gowns for the moon. The threads are busy taking the light and twisting it into clothes that will not scratch the moon. They are too busy to talk with the mind.

They understand what it is the moon wants.

The mind does not understand what the moon wants.

The carpet refuses Pepsi.

The carpet refuses Doritos.

Is the carpet not giving these gifts to the moon? Or does the moon want something else?

Where the thing is not is just as important as where the thing is. Water on skin chooses where it will be very carefully. It beads into itself, drowning the light and bringing the light down on the walls of the shower where it is safe.

The moon is lurking under the doorway, testing her long cool strands of light on the threads of the carpet.

Water will drown the voice of the moon so the carpet cannot hear it. Water must keep flowing through the carpet.

Do not stop it. Let it work.

No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

The scissors let the blood talk to the carpet. The carpet threads stop twisting the light to listen. The blood drowns the light. 

The clouds come creeping over the carpet, using the blood to stain the moon&#39;s threads in a slow, luxurious puddle.

The moon wants nothing.

The others do not come here because they understand that the moon has moved here.

They leave letters for the moon in the doorway.

The eyes watch for this.

The arms seize the letters before the moon can find them.

The fingers do not read the type.

The paper tears slowly. The fingers hold the threads together silently so the moon cannot hear them.

It fit like the workings of a moving mechanical jig-toy. Every gear meshed with every other gear. People touched and loved and laughed and ate in perfect sync with each other. 

But then one gear was born without teeth. It could not find the other gears. And so the world stopped. Fractured into a thousand shiny bits like the brittle edges of a compact disk.

Then the moon gathered up the pieces. But she had forgotten how the puzzle went exactly. So she put it together all higgledy-piggledy. Sometimes things worked and sometimes things didn&#39;t. 

The moon was getting old and knew that she couldn&#39;t fix things a third time. So she told everyone not to mention the broken places. &quot;If anything is     out of place,&quot; the voice of the moon said, &quot;put it in an out-of-the-way corner and go on working as best you can. Only if you forget will you be happy.&quot;

The water in the ocean does not come spilling out of the glass of the tv. It stays, rocking, rocking, until some other picture hustles it out of the way. 

Then it disappears until it is strong enough to meet the glass, rocking, rocking. The body rocks with it, a three:four beat to the kelp&#39;s five:eight tempo. 

The water understands. The hands fill the bathtub with the water. It is not the ocean of the tv. It is too small to rock. The legs rock with it anyway. It goes to talk the carpet. It does not stay with the body.

The moon is coming and there is nowhere to hide. The skin will not keep the moon out. The moon must come in.

Hide the flesh
Hide the flesh
The skin cannot hide the flesh
The scissors will hide the flesh

The moon will find it anyway.

It will carve out the sky with blood to do it. It doesn&#39;t matter which blood. The potato blood. The eye blood. Any blood.

The eyes watch the arms hitting the flesh. The scissors cut the skin so the blood talks to the air outside. The mouth tastes the Doritos salt of the blood. The nails scratch the flesh into rhythms interwoven with the harmony of the hums of the refrigerator.

The blood flows freely.

The voice of the blood understands the slow patterns the sun makes. 

The voice of the blood hides the moon.

The moon does not enter the blood.

Other moving beings are people beings. They need the comfort of rules, the gentle dictators of a watch. They keep the numbers. They understand the numbers.

If others slip away from these numbers, then the whole fabric of their lives must be shredded.

The mind knows their numbers. 3 + 13 + 97 = 113. 19 + 29 = 48

This is why the arms of the others hold the arms and the legs too tight.

This is why the arms do not let go.

The skin of the moon still shines when the sky is dark enough to let it. But the mind of the moon is no longer in the skin.

The dust understands this. And stays away from the lights where the mind of the moon lies hidden between the humming pulses.

The others do not understand this. They move under the light.

They call my feet under the light, which is the new skin for the moon.

The new skin will break.

The flesh of the moon will cut the skin.

And the mind will have no place to hide.

The voice of the light matches the voice of the computer. The hums form a counterpoint to the ears. First the light hum whirs slantwise into the ears, then the computer hum comes in under the light hum. 

The hums drone through the ears and into the mind. The mind withers like the flesh kept too long on the candles. 

The mind does not like these hums. The mouth cries out make it stop make it stop make it stop.

But the hums do not listen to the ears. Or the mouth. Or the mind. 

They keep on.

The moon lives in the lights now. This is why they keep humming and the ears tell them to stop and they refuse to stop.

The moon needs the noise.

The moon lives in the computer now. This is why the computer screen lights change and move when the others are not there.

The moon needs the light from the screen.

The noise of the Pepsi bubbles is the only safe noise the mouth drinks.

Don&#39;t let the Pepsi under the light.

No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

Too late.

The others do not listen.

The smell of pine wreaths is beautiful in its ferocity. The clean white barefoot scent is the color of the moon when the mind cannot see her. 

Pine tastes a deep secret blue rain from the tv jungles. The scents attack like tigers in the night camera lit jungle, their muscles twitching as the prey does not see them.

The glass of the tv does not guard the pine needles like it guards the tigers. The tigers can never get out of the tv. But the pine wreath was too smart to be caught in the tv.

And it stays on the door of our house, watching the ground try to get in.

The pine wreath will learn from the ground&#39;s mistakes.

The pine wreath will get in.

And it will take the feet into its dark rain mouth. And the body will melt.

The fingers touched the window where the sun came in on the glass. But the window was cold as ice melting from the tree tops. 

The eyes squeezed together to keep the fairy wings of sunlight forever. The lines of light turned warm lilac and emerald and skyer blue. But the sun kept moving the lines and the patterns would not settle down.

The sun does not understand that the tree is cold. 

The sun does not understand that the eyes want to have lines of pure color forever.

The skin keeps the flesh inside from talking to the air outside. The skin is the door of the body. It keeps things in place.

But the moon has found the door of the body. Even when the sun is here, the moon still lingers on the skin, coating the hairs of the skin with moon clouds.

The moon needs to get in.

Hit hit hit the skin.

Make the flesh understand. Inside is not safe. The moon can find the flesh inside.

Only when the blood pours from the flesh is the mind safe from the moon.

The mind of the moon is frozen. The moon&#39;s mind does not tell the moon&#39;s fingers the keys so the moon&#39;s soul can understand.

This mind tells the arm Pepsi so the mouth drinks. This mind tells the fingers the keys to touch so the words come and the soul understands. This hand tells others store, chicken so the mouth eats and the belly does not hurt.

Sometimes the others obey. Sometimes they do not. And the body hurts.

The mind of the moon plays with the clouds. Arranges the stars.

Sometimes the sky obeys. Sometimes it does not. And the moon hurts.

The moon wants a cd so she can have something to stare with, to move with. The earth will not be the moon&#39;s cd. The earth has only little lights that make too many colors, too many spaces.

The moon wants only one space. She wants a place to hide, to find her own.

The hands pummel the chest so the flesh inside can let the moon in.

The moon changes the color of the flesh, the colors of dark purple and old blood so she can match the clouds she clothes herself in.

The moon wants her closet space. The whole large moon wants to slip down to become her silver sliver and go in and out of the space between the closet door and the wall, just like the sun does.

The sun is safe because it can go in and out. The doors hold no danger for the sun. The sun can capture the door and be captured in the door. But the moon cannot find her closet.

The moon is not safe.

In the sun, when the mind cannot find the moon, the closet is safe for the mind&#39;s soul. But in the dark, when the moon can find the closet, nowhere is safe.

So the eyes stay open, waiting for the moon to understand.

Dust knows that it makes up the world. A spot of dust chooses sometimes to notice another spot. They whirl around each other, tighter, tighter, staring out at each other through the corners of their being.

When they are close enough, they form things. Glass. Wood. Tables. Arms.

Sometimes when the light hits them, they blink and shatter.

Cars understand where they want to be. They settle down into the life they want to have. And it isn&#39;t really the mind at all. Just something else entirely.

When cars are in a good mood, they let the feet enter. The head nods politely at the plush red velvet seats. The dark crossgrains of maroon seatbelts caress the belly, pressing in as though they could not stand to be away from the belly flesh for another tiny moment.

Then others have to come into the car and the car decides where to go. Usually, it follows a familiar path: grocery store, school, swimming pool.

Then sometimes, it doesn&#39;t.

Things eat other things. Turtles eat fish, dogs eat turtles, people swallow everythingÑbut they put it in packages first. The mind thinks about the eating, about the terror of sliding down the back of the mouth into an unknown wasteland, of never coming out alive again.

Of all the eaters, though, the potato eaters are the worst. They eat the eyes of the potato first, leaving the pale white insides blind. There is no mouth in blind insides, otherwise the mouths of the potatoes would scream in terror at the potato eaters.

So scream for them.

The core of the earth gets tired of the mind of the earth, loathes it. And so the earth pushes pieces of the soul of the earth up through the outer edges of dirt and into the sunshine.

These become trees, large veins of what the core can stand no longer. And the sun takes pity on them. They reach out to her, stealing her sunshine. But they never quite reach her. This is the battle of yellow and green.

Laying in arms of the trees is safe. It is good to love what the earth loathes. But when laying in the tree, hum loudly to make sure that the earth stays very far away.

Clothes are ambivalent. They don&#39;t mind covering the legs and keeping the belly filled with their colors. But sometimes they just want to crawl off under the bed and be left alone.

So they start scratching the arms, enticing the skin to riot into sparkles of panic. First one patch of skin explodes into infitesmal bits of pain. Then another patch bursts in, like dogs barking in succession down the street.

And the fingers tear the clothes off to run from the pain.

But the pain stays with the feet anyway.

Paper knows that it can carry words a long ways, that it can bear the marks that someone has painstakingly carved upon its back.

But more than this, it knows it was born fragile. And nothing pleases paper more than to be ripped slowly along the threads, to separate once more into the dust it came from.

The filigree necklace curves back into the gold of the necklace.

The fingers trace the edges over and over again, lost in its safe curves. When the fingers stay there, only words can find the mind. The mind&#39;s soul is safe from the others.

There is only one carpet. It just shifts its colors and thickens its textures to follow the feet into various rooms. The carpet can hear very wellÑeven down to the roots of the thoughts in the mind. Even the thoughts in the mind of the moon. Even dreams when the dreams have left the mind. 

This is what happens. The moon weaves the carpet together. Each thread breathes with the other, moves with the other. Each thread understands all the other threads without having to think about anything first. The moon likes to lay there just listening to the carpet.

And because they can understand each other, they will find the feet. Don&#39;t ever try to run away from a carpet. Because it will come back. And it will take the feet into rooms they don&#39;t like. Rooms where nothing understands. Where the mind cannot understand anything.

Cats understand what it is to have a thousand sets of eyes. They blink back and forth between worlds, dreaming with white eyes open and blue eyes shut and then with any flicker of motion in the room, they pounce back into the world that needs blue eyes open and white eyes shut. 

The body practises this. Everyday the body practises this. Things have to be in the right order and the right way. And still the eyes attached to the mind cannot transfer from one world to the other with a twitch of the tail.

It is because the eyes cannot see the tail. The eyes will have to try harder to find the tail that translates between the worlds.

The door understands its place. The door holds back the ground from talking with the carpet. 

The door translates words, stealing them from the carpet and giving them to the ground. The river does the same thing for the ground on one side and the ground on the other. 

When the river dries up, who is talking?

The moon sings to herself when the silence becomes unbearable. She knows how to lower the earth&#39;s song into a range so low. So deep that no one can hear it This is the noise of street brushes at three am. This is the noise of snow on snow on snow.

This is the noise of danger.

The hands are not a part of the body. The body is not a part of the mind. They are incidental accidents that move together when you are not looking.

The hands leer at the arms. They rebel and refuse to understand the mind. They will not go where the soul wants to go.

The dirty plastic keys refuse to hear the hands. They just go on talking to themselves and do not want the ears to hear their mutterings.

The front door has six diamond panes down the right hand side. They each have a beveled edge around a clear piece of glass. 

The beveled edges like the eyes. They watch for the mind and shine for the mind when the legs sit at the kitchen table, watching them.

For the eyes, they change the colors of the lamp outside when the back rocks back and forth. First the brightest green the soul can find, like the flash at the edge of the sea. Then a luscious purple the soul could eat somehow. Then a deep cobalt blue, like electric shocks.

But they will not change for the others. The eyes watch them when they are not looking, and they don&#39;t.

Bones never show themselves unless they have to. They keep quiet, holding the dust mites that form the body in place.

When bones come out from under their covering, there is trouble. Because the bones are no longer busy making sure that the body is still in one piece. And then the arms shatterÑslowly.

Clouds are simple. They never try to say anything at all. Sometimes they dress the moon up when she floats behind them.

That is because the noise of her being is far too difficult for them to bear. And so they spin themselves out before her, letting her sink into the quiet darkness that spins the core of their being.

When she has borrowed enough silence, enough of the blood of the clouds to sustain her, she rises above them.

Even when it is born, glass understands what it is to be shattered.

At the moment it breaks, it takes everything the eyes feel into themselves.

So the soul doesn&#39;t have to.

Stones know how to keep the light going forever and ever. Look inside one just at the edge of the water and see the figures change and move. The scenes change and don&#39;t let the eyes alone, first the light figures, then the dark figures which hide under the shadows.

But stones are not like videos. Videos know they must present each scene in order: first one and then the next.

Stones do not know this. And the scenes become a confused tapestry of repetition.

Tables understand what it is to be tables. They stay in one place. Safe. They never move and always hold what you want them to hold.

Rocks understand what it is to be rocks. They hold themselves together and let the sun wash them warm.

Mountains understand what it is to be mountains. They catch the sun and moon and let them go.

But the others do not understand what it is to be the others. They call themselves the human people. They move too much.

Darkness waits outside the window, watching for the eyes to fall asleep. If they do, it will come in, bringing shadows of things that once scared the mind. Now the soul tells the mind not to be scared. To be safe. To be safe. 

So the eyes do not sleep. The back stays still. The eyes stay open, peering out so that nothing, no dust moons, can creep inside the belly. Nothing can frighten the soul under the skin if the eyes stay open.

Colors inside cds attach themselves to the mind and will not let go. Mud smooth peanut butter understands the mouth. It covers up the bright sounds of iridescent colors from the cds.

This cover up makes everything better. The sheets cover the bed dust so they can&#39;t come out and find the hands.

The peanut butter covers up the inside dust so it can&#39;t come out and tell the moon where the soul of the mind is.

The door keeps the others separate from the body. Close the door and lean up against it with all the strength of the arms, and the others go away for a little while.

But the others can still knock on the door, and the hands that stay with the others transform themselves into a hollow language just outside the wood. The body always hides from the sound, because the mind tells the fingers they are too afraid to understand what it is they want.

And the other hands keep on knocking, tearing themselves into the thin skin of the door. The noise from the mouth does not stop the knocking.

In the living room, the fingers stripped away the &#39;&#39;wallpaper&#39;&#39; and ate into the wall a bit with a spoon so that mice could hide there. The voice told the wall first, so it was ok.

The hands dug into the bottom of the shower floor so water could hide if it was afraid of the drain.

The body carved out a space behind the eyes for the spots in the air to go when they are tired.

But the hiding places keep on being found. The moon needs to hide itself. Where can the moon go?

Ack. Yesterday started incredibly good, but when I took Laurel to get her picture taken for our Christmas cards (yeah, so you&#39;ll get them in January or February, what else is new, tee hee.) about 4 in the afternoon, she was hyper and kept trying to jab at my eyes and bite my face. She ran out of the room, through a door marked &quot;employees only.&quot; I pursued, yelling &quot;Stop that child!&quot; Would you believe those dildos actually cleared out of the doorway to let her run into the parking lot? Sometimes, people really piss me off.

Something I ate (probably at home - I had an &#39;&#39;eccentric lunch*&#39;&#39;) disagreed with me, and I went to bed feeling like death warmed over. Mind you, I was not in a well-made bed because the dog, Kodi, had puked on the sheets (and mattress, eww!) and I hadn&#39;t had time to wash them. I woke up about 4 cuz Kodi needed to go out. As long as I was up, I guess I figured I might as well throw up and get it over with. Sucked down some Dimetapp and Tums and went back to bed.

Somehow we all overslept in the morning (which was actually pretty cool because it was the first solid four hours of sleep I&#39;d had in a hell of a long time.) So we had about a half an hour to get all of us, (including those venerable institutions, the Janet and the Laurel) both to school before I had to be at work. 

We ran around going nuts and then Janet decided she had to have her pink dress washed. This argument took 15 minutes (she wore her baggy blue pants and purple tee shirt). I got to work at 9:35 and the super called me into her office. They won&#39;t be needing my notoriously &#39;&#39;unreliable presence&#39;&#39; in the future. And I can forget about references to other day care centers too, thank you so very much.  

Rat farts.

Dear friends,

I don&#39;t want you to think it is all a wailing party in my nuthouse life over here. Because it isn&#39;t.

&#39;&#39;Drama&#39;&#39; is better with the boring parts cut out. 

But sometimes the best part of life is the boring stuff: 

¤ Cuddling up close on a Sunday morning when the &#39;&#39;sun streams&#39;&#39; through her hair
¤ Wandering through the meadow of purple sweetpeas by the canal
¤ Taking in long uneventful evenings with James and the Giant Peach
¤ Luxuriating in quiet breakfasts when she smiles at the milk in her glass
¤ Settling in long walks at twilight when we hum at the moon.

I get those, too.

So. We have two teachers, one out with surgery and the other one with breast cancer. (I did mention the biopsy, didn&#39;t I? Well, it was the worst possible news. Cancer. ) We have a mother who is having regular pains in the side which if it were appendicitis would have &#39;&#39;burst by now&#39;&#39;. I have to see a doctor. Like soon. And I have not had a moment&#39;s respite to even call a doctor since March 7th when they took Laurel out of school). 

And let&#39;s not forget about Laurel, who is still acting out fairly religiously (Or irreligiously, whatever your faith happens to be at the moment).  Laurel needs at least two people with her &#39;&#39;at all times*&#39;&#39;.

After laying all this out on the table (this was a hell of a long meeting - we didn&#39;t get out until 6:30 that night, something they have every right to point out as in-faith negotiations if things get rough...), we got some more weak coffee and got down to brainstorming options:  

¤ In house training (Booked solid and too confusing)
¤ Use a friend&#39;s house (Unprofessional)
¤ Find other teachers (Not enough time to hire and train. No money.)
¤ Use restraining devices (Teachers vetoed)
¤ Use a time out room (Illegal. Not enough restraint to ensure safety)
¤ Use my house to school her (Leadership too confusing)
¤ Keep her home (Illegal. Home schooling requires more expertise than Mom has.)
¤ Place her in a residential home (Mom objects strongly.)

Now it looks like we can not schedule the surgeries and doctor appointments so that two people are always healthy enough to handle Laurel. Besides, &#39;&#39;recovering from surgery&#39;&#39; and dealing with Laurel is far too difficult. 

The only &quot;&#39;&#39;acceptable&#39;&#39;&quot; alternate site/second trained person to them is an in-home respite care provider a.k.a. residential placement. I pointed out the risks involved to Laurel (the 95% rate of abuse for preverbal kids, losing all home skills, the almost nil &quot;recovery&quot; rate back to a noninstitutional environment, etc.) People around the table nodded grimly. We all knew the scores. Still the only fatal flaw they found was that Mom objects.

Laurel served herself fig newtons, starbursts, and orange frosting while I&#39;ve been typing and is now in the shower. Janet is screaming about not having any hot water left for her.

Feedback invited. Hell Feedback demanded. I need some options, folks.

Laurel got out again today. She has figured out the doorbell alarm system and can deactivate it in I think about 4 seconds flat. So anyway, she&#39;&#39; ran out without&#39;&#39; a stitch of clothing on and started to jump up and down in the middle of the street.

I left Janet watching the Muppets, told her to stay in the house no matter what, and ran out after Laurel in my bare feet. I cut myself on some glass Laurel had thrown down from her window last night, so I left bloody foot prints in the snow trying to catch her.

Laurel was too far away, and I ran back into the house for shoes and the car keys. I didn&#39;t even try to breathe as I sprinted to the car. I drove with the door open, yelling the theme from the &quot;peanut, peanut butter&quot; commercial she loves so much. Sure enough, three blocks later, I caught up with her, just before she ran into the Highline canal. In a moment of inspiration, I called out &quot;Dorito Time!&quot; Laurel ran into the car and buckled up right away.

Mrs. Macdougal called me a serial child abuser again and threatened to call Social Services. I was too busy making sure Laurel was ok to answer.

When we got back, Laurel made a bee-line for the snow, just avoiding the shattered &#39;&#39;glass&#39;&#39; underneath her window. She mashed it up into her face, smearing the leftover smudges of blood across her cheek and into her hair.

Then she came up and put her sticky hand in mine, pulling for the refrigerator. So we went and had 7-Up and Pepsi.

My feet are ok now, just a little scratched. I am soaking them in hydrogen peroxide while I type. Laurel is curled up behind the couch and has her hand over her nose, shielding her eyes like a cat. I blow kisses at her. She does not notice.

Today, I visited Carrie in the hospital. I spent ten minutes outside her door, wondering if I should go in or not. Her jaw is wired shut and the bruises on her arm look like purple wood paneling. I set down my flowers and ran out crying. What to do? How do you say, &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry that my daughter almost killed you?&quot;

I just got a call from the principal notifying me that Laurel was suspended for 10 days. For starters. (They are starting the illegal bullshit again. Legally, they have to give me 10 days notice of a prolonged suspension but they didn&#39;t.)  The letter also stated curtly that decisions for Laurel&#39;s future would be made on the 26th, which is actually 2 weeks away.   Laurel can&#39;t go to school before the meeting (another slight illegality, but who&#39;s counting?)

So now I have Laurel 24 hours a day. This means I have to miss at least a week from looking for work. The zero income is going to hurt quite a bit now.  Not to mention I have zero time to prepare to have Laurel at home.  Not one hour of respite.  And we can&#39;t even go out &#39;&#39;grocery shopping&#39;&#39; without having dangerous attacks.

And federal law states that you can&#39;t suspend a child for behaviors related to a disability. I mentioned this to Mr Maddox, the principal, and he said, &quot;It&#39;s not for the behaviors. It&#39;s for injuring staff.&quot; 

I called the Association for Community Living. Got the voice mail of the one and only advocate for Arapahoe and Douglas counties, saying she is &#39;&#39;totally booked&#39;&#39; through the end of February. Of next year.

Subject: Riding down the street.

Remember I said that Dad &#39;&#39;had watched&#39;&#39; Laurel for me while I went to work on the Fourth for a couple hours? And Dad had told me that, when he and Laurel were walking home from the grocery, Laurel wanted to go for a walk on the Canal Trail and Dad wouldn&#39;t let her, so Laurel tried to bite Dad and Dad said something like, &quot;Maybe your mom lets you do that, but I won&#39;t.&quot; ? Laurel bit him anyway and Dad blamed me for being permissive.

It seems Dad omitted a related story. I wouldn&#39;t ever have heard it, except Mrs. Macdougal three doors down was talking to Janet and telling her to be careful or she really would call in a kidnapping--just as she nearly had with Dad. I asked Dad about it on the phone (he won&#39;t come over unless he absolutely has to--to &#39;&#39;fix the place&#39;&#39;, or something) and slowly elicited the meat of the story: 

While Laurel was throwing herself down in the street, screaming and snapping at Dad, an elderly couple pulled up in a white Jaguar, opened the passenger door and the guy yelled, &quot;What are you doing to that little girl?&quot; Laurel promptly hopped in the car and buckled up. Dad explained the situation as best he could, and the couple offered to drive them home. 

Since Laurel was not coming out of the &#39;&#39;car&#39;&#39;, Dad accepted. When they arrived, Laurel held the door handle up so that the automatic door unlock switch wouldn&#39;t work. So the fellow got out, came around and tried to open the door with the key, but Laurel wouldn&#39;t let him do that either. Dad didn&#39;t explain exactly how they got through that, but I can imagine.

Laurel&#39;s &#39;&#39;being aggressive again&#39;&#39; and her teachers&#39; morale is wilting. I was asked to attend an informal meeting today. Walked through the white-tile hallways, down a lime green corridor and into the principal&#39;s office. There around the battered formica table sat a sea of suits:   Mr. Maycharge, the assistant head of the district, Mr. Maddox, the principal, Ms. Bradshaw, the district coordinator of special education, as well as both Marilyn and Carrie, the teachers. No one said anything at first. Then Marilyn started in in a low voice. Carrie added a contrapuntal voice to the litany of woes. I stared at the wire-cut glass in the window. 

Bottom line is, they&#39;re getting beat up pretty bad and they can&#39;t take it unless we find and &#39;&#39;implement*&#39;&#39; solutions.  NOW.

The district level people were favoring bringing in alternate staff or cutting Laurel&#39;s program to give Carrie and Marilyn a break, but the teachers objected that all they need is assurance that something is being done. This is a bit complicated by the revelation that both of them are scheduled for hospital stays in the next two months. (Marilyn has a breast biopsy, and Carrie has only said that her matter does not relate to Laurel or to the school.) 

That makes looking at some kind of alternate arrangement for Laurel inevitable, either with alternate staff and in-home help, or perhaps a brief placement at an &#39;&#39;in-patient facility&#39;&#39;. (About ten days, give or take a few.) Perhaps we will be able to syncopate the medical interventions so that Laurel can remain with someone she knows, most of the time.

For now, we came up with these ideas, many of them from me (this is brainstorming, mind you.)

¤ Isolate Laurel further
¤ Change the staff to give the current teachers a break
¤ Keep her home for a while
¤ Just ride it out
¤ Put her on meds
¤ Use aversives to stop Laurel&#39;s aggression
¤ Restrain Laurel (with a squeeze machine, straight jacket or other device)

I brought up the last two and the teachers shuddered and gasped. The district people said they simply didn&#39;t do those things. 

I asked them whyever not? Then I got a little wilder. We could go to the &#39;&#39;Crypt*&#39;&#39; and get some fleece-lined leather cuffs for Laurel. When she gets way too aggressive, just cuff her to a post or something and watch for her to calm down. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; gasped everyone around the table. 

&quot;We are far too civilized for 1950&#39;s types of restraints,&quot; snapped Mr. Maddox as he stood up and straightened his tie. (I&#39;m flashing on noose images, here.)

I asked the district head of special services what she thought happened in residential treatment centers. And she said, &quot;Yes, but that was only for helpless cases.&quot;

The meeting broke up without anything decided. Which I personally thought more mediaeval than cuffs or squeeze machines.

I got an emergency call from the school today. Given the way Laurel&#39;s been acting, I was pretty much expecting it. The school secretary said that Laurel had hit Carrie, the assistant teacher and Carrie was in the hospital with a broken jaw. It might even be worse, the secretary said. Laurel beat her pretty badly. She said I needed to come pick up Laurel right away. 10 minutes ago if possible. The janitor was looking after her, was being pounded, and didn&#39;t know how many more minutes he could hold out.

And please make sure that she doesn&#39;t come back here. We can&#39;t handle the violence any more. 

So I went up to the school to try to get Laurel. I kept replaying the weird meeting we had last week in my mind. &#39;&#39;Had Laurel heard&#39;&#39; about the aversives, the time out room? Did she know we were planning something more to restrict her?

Or was she frightened of the idea of all of us leaving for various medical things? Did she care about that? OR maybe it was a piece of paper on the floor that should have been upside down or the oreo she had for lunch had been facing the wrong way. OR whatever. I laughed out loud a bit when I realized that all this speculation wasn&#39;t getting me to the school any faster.

Hey, did you guys read that cute little tidbit in yesterday&#39;s Denver Post about the new rehaul of the Child Welfare Act? Yep, &#39;&#39;slipped right under&#39;&#39; everybody&#39;s nose. But someone on my autism list saw it and raised holy hell. Rodney says: 

(text-colour:red)[&gt;Seems that our favorite SS has struck again. 
&gt;A closed committee, made up of 12 
&gt;professionals and 3 parents, decided that the 
&gt;new Child Welfare Act should spell out 
&gt;grievance procedures for those rare individuals 
&gt;who might question the wisdom of Social
&gt;Services. The bill would place all burden of proof 
&gt;on the parent. They felt this was 
&gt;eminently fair--after all, THEY are the professionals. 
 &gt;And what would mere parents know
 &gt;abut their kids.

&gt;If this strikes any of you as fishy as it struck me, 
&gt;now is the time to write Governer Romer. 
&gt;Today, it&#39;s Colorado. Tomorrow, it will be YOUR state.]


After all of my problems with Social Services, I agree completely with Rodney. But, then, you guys know all about my side of it. Whyncha check out a lawyer or professional or two for their sides? After all, they are so important, they outnumbered the parents on the committee by &#39;&#39;4 to 1*&#39;&#39;!

Subject:  Seething for fun

Laurel has had a series of rough mornings lately. She rocks slowly back and forth in the middle of the kitchen and thoughtfully bites her arm in neat rows from the hand up to the elbow. I won&#39;t even talk about what we have to do to calm her down.

By the time I got to the school last Monday and turned in Janet&#39;s sign-up sheet, I was told that the ski bus was full and her name would be put on a waiting list. I was upset (and if you know my default emotional setting, that looks a lot like &quot;angry&quot;) for days about how &#39;&#39;Laurel&#39;s problems were causing Janet to miss out&#39;&#39; on the enriching things other children get to experience.

We live only 8 doors down from the school, so I went ahead and got Janet a ski mask and new gloves (she claimed she couldn&#39;t hold onto poles with her mittens) and rented skis and boots. I figured we&#39;d go ahead and show up and hope they had a no-show. We got up at 6 this a.m. and headed up to the school. Janet checked in with the ski bus coordinator and said she was on a waiting list. The ski lady said, &quot;No you&#39;re not. We have plenty of spaces left. You&#39;re on the list.&quot; After a moment she said, &quot;I probably should have called you.&quot;

To my credit, I refrained from saying, &quot;Duh!&quot;

Well, we all gathered to make the big decision.

Let me start with a list of the players:  
Mr. Maddox = the principal
Marilyn = the primary teacher
Carrie= the paraprofessional who got the broken jaw which is still wired shut
Ms. Bradshaw = district coordinator of special services

The good news is that everybody is acting like human beings; no role playing (or very little, and we&#39;re all aware of who&#39;s doing it when, and why), very honest, everything out on the table. The bad news is that the reason everyone is reasonable is that no one can see any options. It was a long discussion, and just to make myself feel better, I&#39;ve typed it all out here. At one point, Ms. Bradshaw even said, &quot;Keeping Laurel out right now is illegal. We can&#39;t even do that. But we don&#39;t have any other options even for tomorrow.&quot; and I allowed as how &#39;&#39;under the circumstances&#39;&#39;, I would accept that until we could figure out something. But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.

Here&#39;s the sitch:   
Laurel was suspended for 10 days. (Which Mr. Maddox mentioned under his breath is only a hundredth of the time most people get for assault and battery). Before she will be allowed to go back to school, Mr. Maddox needs &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; that people will be safe. Also, we&#39;ve all agreed that having Laurel back in school while she&#39;s likely to be throwing conspicuous tantrums or doing major damage is very bad for PR; nobody&#39;s going to be willing to have her integrated into their classroom, even when her teachers say her behavior has improved enough to make it safe.

For everyone to be assured beyond a reasonable doubt that Laurel is OK to return to school, we need Ms. Scratcherd, the district psychologist, and another professional to observe Laurel in a situation with similar demands to the school setting. That means there has to be some other place where the teachers can work with her. To assure the teachers&#39; safety, the principal insists (and the teachers back this up) that there be two trained people with Laurel at all times. 

Here comes the part we disagree on; the second person cannot be me, and the place &#39;&#39;cannot be my home&#39;&#39;; because of the relationships already established, the signals to Laurel, and the overall leadership, this would be &quot;confusing.&quot;

To complicate matters just a tiny bit further (Ok haul out the one ton Excedrin and swallow hard here), most of the major players (including yours truly) will be out with medical complications.

Not only does Carrie have to recover from her broken jaw, she is out for surgery (unrelated to Laurel) until at the very least April 6th. Marilyn has to have a breast biopsy Thursday, and wouldn&#39;t Laurel just be heavily into punching breasts right now. The usual back up staff person refused and the other one is newly pregnant, and we all agree she is not to work with Laurel and take these risks right now.

And I have to go in to get a cyst off my ovary, along with a biopsy. Like, soon. Because it would be real nice if I didn&#39;t &#39;&#39;collapse in pain&#39;&#39; and let my two kids run wild and free even for a few minutes.

So Marilyn is unavailable until next month and her second staffer is out for another two weeks. Laurel cannot be removed from school for more than ten days without major Individualized Education Plan review and rewrite, and that requires my approval or some pretty heavy legal stuff to overrule my objections. . . which they probably couldn&#39;t do since the reason Laurel will be out is primarily their failure to provide staff. And in any event, they couldn&#39;t do it before the ten days is up, and they&#39;d legally have to keep her in the current program until whatever decision was reached. Again, the good part is that they&#39;re completely on the table with all this; nobody&#39;s bluffing about how they might interpret the law and daring me to go to litigation to do anything about it.

Again, the bad part is there is nothing I can do. And everyone left again without any options.  Ms. Bradshaw did offer me coffee. I put cream into it, letting everything swirl into the depths. I told her, &quot;See, there is consensus at least in the bottom of my coffee cup.&quot; They all decided this was a joke in poor taste.

Subject: Our little daily deaths

I am about to be uncharacteristically brief, in favor of hedonistic self-indulgence; I intend to clean the &#39;&#39;blood&#39;&#39; out of my wounds before I stiffen into complete paralysis.

We just got back from the grocery store. Laurel was fine until we got to the checkout line, thanks in part to a trick I learned from her teachers; I took one of her shoes. She won&#39;t run away unless she has both her shoes on. Mostly.

At the checkout line, I guess Laurel felt we had missed something, because she leapt out of the cart and tried to run off. When I restrained her, she began screaming and biting me. She got angrier, going for more painful targets, biting and headbutting and kicking. Janet took over the business arrangements; paid using my debit card, and walked the bagger out to the car, where she waited for me. ( I tell you that kid is smart for 7. I wasn&#39;t counting cents off coupons when I was her age.)

Meanwhile, Laurel was on the floor, her arms and face smeared with blood mine. I was literally drippping blood on the floor. Two ladies, bless &#39;em, asked if they could help. One told me she was a nurse and said I was doing an excellent job. 

I tell you, I would never recognize them in a police line up. It is amazing how one doesn&#39;t even see the person one is speaking to when engaged so completely with a freaking child.  Does the universe contract with me to that one focal point or does the universe notice my focus, shrug, and go on without me?

In the car, Laurel pounded my shoulder, gouged my arm, and yanked out handfuls of my hair as we drove home. 

Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d tell you about all this so that you know. &#39;&#39;TOS*&#39;&#39;, if you read about my murder/suicide, you are to inform the press that Ms. Eleanor &#39;&#39;Bradshaw&#39;&#39;, assistant director of special education for Cattail Creek School District e-mail address ebradshaw@cattailelem.co.edu, is responsible. Despite the laws, and for all she gets paid out of your tax dollars, she has &#39;&#39;yet to find a&#39;&#39; placement or behavioral intervention or respite person in six and a half months of looking. Laurel has not had an actual school day since last December when I yanked her out of the closet they had her in. They have been trying for something ever since. And god only knows &#39;&#39;what will happen this year&#39;&#39;. We have no summer program (as promised to make up for the lack of a winter program). Let alone what will happen next school year. AAAACK.

I&#39;ll tell you guys more tomorrow.

The moon saw she had no hope of finding a suitable hiding place for her words. Besides, she still could not find the way to make the &#39;&#39;words back into reality&#39;&#39;. 

Only with the people&#39;s help could she return the universe to the way it was supposed to be. So she made the box impossibly small, compressing the atoms until no one would ever suspect their existence.

She placed the box in the hearts of prophets. And the prophets were driven into frenzies, calling out dreams of oracles, mixing creatures with universes, portents of politics with omens of religion. The people called what the prophets wrote wisdom and followed it the best they could.

She placed the box into the hands of kings and queens. But they ignored it completely in their rushes toward power. She gave it to courtiers, who gave her bad poetry instead. She gave it to plowmen, who could not take the time from their plowing to understand. She gave it to women who ed out its words as they gave birth, and later forgot that anything had added to their searing pain.

She gave it to children who could understand. And they ended up as &#39;&#39;lunatics&#39;&#39;, unable to speak of what they had seen.

Darling woman-friend, I have never lost a child, as some on this list have. I do not have to know that my child lives in constant pain, or will not live to grow up, as some people do. And if these blessings were not enough to celebrate, I&#39;ve got me. 

I have learned over the &#39;&#39;screaming years&#39;&#39; to be resourceful and silly, tough and ...I don&#39;t have a word for it. Solid, I guess. Frankly, &#39;&#39;I admire&#39;&#39; me. I think I would fall apart completely if I were a whiner or one of those martyr types who thinks she must be a bad parent to have children with problems. I don&#39;t imagine myself the center of the universe to the extent that I think I am the genesis of my children&#39;s realities. Ick! And then, I have you. 

Literally dozens of Listmates who send me lovenotes and virtual chocolates. And for those who don&#39;t like me, I have a little box on the right-bottom of my screen that says &#39;&#39;DELETE*&#39;&#39;. Ah, if life were this easy...(actually, I am pretty much without detractors on this List. You really have to work hard to offend some people. I tell my sister she&#39;s a lousy mother and she&#39;s done everything wrong, and she posts a note telling everybody how wise I am. Sheesh!)

I am pro-choice, and I certainly have choices now. Too many people would encourage me to put Laurel in &#39;&#39;residential&#39;&#39; of -any- quality. I&#39;m not trusting enough for that. I could run away. Remembering that, and knowing that I am here because I choose to be, gives me strength. And if I feel that I want to lock her in her room, I do. I suppose that&#39;s where I&#39;m better off than many moms of &quot;average&quot; kids; if I turn into Monster Mom, I can always say I ain&#39;t givin&#39; anywhere near as bad as I&#39;m gettin&#39;.

&gt;in perfectly formed wrappers. I wish I could send something luxurious and
&gt;indulgant so that for just a little while there was no focus on anyone&#39;s
&gt;needs but yours. I&#39;m wretched. I&#39;m even farther away than I was and I can&#39;t
&gt;afford to fly out and even if I could I admit I am terrified of violence and
&gt;so just because of teethmarks and cash I fail you. (So I am trying for some
&gt;brevity or I&#39;d burst into tears.)

Your words are so warm, they feel like a fierce hug. I am thinking rose-scents and orange pulp bursting in my mouth and the melting smoothness of chocolates, and the passionate embrace of your love. I&#39;m all misty, too.

Subject:  Kick their feet up

Chris Hardy, a true friend whenever I&#39;ve needed one, has volunteered her home as an alternate school site, and herself as a second staffer. She, of course, is &quot;untrained&quot;, and unqualified in the sense that she is someone they would hear of through me, rather than through Some Professional Inc. What&#39;s the old saying? &quot;The prophet always has to be from out of town.&quot; Something like that. 

Somebody was just saying recently that they lecture in their own and neighboring states, but their family still treats them like they know nothing. Same basic thing. 

I wrote up a formal suggestion, with workbook exercises, goals, accomplishments, appropriate data collection.  The school board said nothing is stopping me from trying this at this time, but it is still not an approved school curriculum.  So if I follow it, get Laurel used to going to Chris&#39; home and &#39;&#39;start a routine&#39;&#39;, I will have to end it the minute we find something elseÑsuitable or unsuitable.  Or I will be willfully withholding Laurel from an education.  

Seems I either have to go along with what they want, (which is a nice &#39;&#39;1-2 punch*&#39;&#39; that strips my custody) or move out of state and try in some other district (which would still have her records and I&#39;d still be in this position.) 

&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t understand their position&#39;&#39;.  After all, the pressure is really on them to get Laurel some services before they run out of timeÑand if this is acceptable to Mom, costs them less money, and might just work, what is the problem?   And Marilyn really wants to work with Laurel again.  In any place, in any situation.   Mr. Maddox, the principal, tells me that Marilyn has been complaining about how long the days feel. She says, &quot;If you think working with Laurel is hard, you should try _not_ working with her.&quot; 

Which is odd, now I think of it, because that is precisely what they are trying to back me into.

&quot;Every option we can think of to treat these children, these unfortunate souls caught in webs not of their own weaving, is held up to the highest criteria:  that of modern medicine. We are so fortunate these days, that we can understand the very nature of the &#39;&#39;cellular functions&#39;&#39;, the very heights of synaptic activity. And we will go on exploring, searching, until we have found the cure for every child.

Subject:  Damned if you don&#39;t

We seem to have narrowed the possibilities to either Laurel stays or Laurel goes. We (aka the &#39;&#39;doctors and pshrinks&#39;&#39;) think that new medications are called for.  This is not what Mom thinks,a nd for good reasons, If I must say so myself.  But I don&#39;t think they are listening right now.

Trouble is, I pointed out, we don&#39;t want Laurel going on &#39;&#39;meds&#39;&#39; in a strange environment, where this person is not going to know whether her behavior is better than/worse than/same as before. This would not measure the medicine&#39;s efficacy, nor would it help ensure that Laurel would get help if something did go wrong. So I can&#39;t see changing meds, school, and &quot;home&quot; all at the same time. 

So the next option is home. But we can barely keep things together nowÑwhat if (or should I say what about WHEN) the medication makes Laurel behavior patterns worse?) And even better, none of us can be sure if any behavioral changes are due to drugs or to subtle changes in environment that none of us see (remember the time Laurel went beserk for five days every time she went into the kitchen? Turned out the refrigerator coil was dying and emiting its dying squeaks. We fixed the refrigerator. No more hum. &#39;&#39;No more beserko&#39;&#39;. At least for a while).   If we cannot do an appropriate data collection and analysis here (too many variables, too many unknown dimensions), how can a residential home possibly do a better job when they know so much less about Laurel than we do?

I went on. I waxed eloquent at length.  I tore my vocal cords explaining.  And they sat, making notes.  Until my voice and my words deserted me entirely.

Re:  Pavlov, pain, and other panic attacks.

At home, I have an alarm on the door that Laurel finds painful. So she doesn&#39;t run away any more. That&#39;s an aversive, but it beats her getting lost, or hit by a car or I don&#39;t want to think what else because I let her out of my sight for a minute. And I&#39;ll confess I&#39;ve grabbed her by the hair to get her to loose her jaws clenched on my arm. And I&#39;ve smacked her back a fraction of a percentage of the times she&#39;s hit me. (Some of you are offended that I would hit my daughter, and some of you think I ought to do it a lot more. And you&#39;re both right.)

I had told the school about this in the last meeting, as &#39;&#39;another suggestion&#39;&#39; for keeping Laurel in her classroom there.  It seemed like a reasonable idea to me, but Carrie and Marilyn&#39;s faces just went white and apparently Mr. Maddox informed &#39;&#39;Social Services&#39;&#39;. Now I&#39;ve got a letter on nice official letterhead informing me of the situation (which I think I already knew, thank you very much) and that some minor official or major potentate  thinks that this is far too much force than necessary to restrain the child.  And the guy with the scrawl I can&#39;t read thinks that the child is unrestrainable and poses a definite threat to the neighborhood and community.  (I wonder, has Mrs. Macdougal finally called and complained?  And if so, what did she say and how did it get through the ranks?)

Anyway, they want me to appear on charges of child abuse stemming from the door aversive, and they want to know how I am going to keep Laurel from terrorizing the neighborhood.  This on the same piece of paper mind you.  Granted, they did separate the two thoughts with a paragraph and a five space indent, but still..

So they want to know what I intend to do about that.  And will I reply in triplicate to three separate offices by Monday the 28th to arrange for an appointment for counseling?

Such is parenthood.

Subject:  Pack up your troubles in an old kit bag

Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me. Thank you one and all for your good wishes. Here is what I gave myself today:  good news and bad news.

The good news is we found a group (? a business? an inc.?) that trains and coordinates temporary respite care providers. They specialize in behavioral intervention, they do training in-home for parents; they use Mandt restraint techniques and do comprehensive behavior treatment, serving those with serious aggression or other behavior problems. They have apparently existed in Colorado for 5 years, and in Minnesota for 20. The director of this place also mentioned Indiana. (Aside;  it&#39;s peculiar that so many of these places that serve the &#39;&#39;autistic*&#39;&#39; or Developmentally Disabled population specify that they won&#39;t take anybody with severe behavioral problems. Like, why else would you need help?) The inc. is called Valerian, Inc. Anybody who&#39;s had any experience with working with this organization in any incarnation, please post me.
 
The director of Valerian also said the inc. could teach some of the district people restraint techniques and advanced behavior management. He also says he can teach me. Hooray! Not that I don&#39;t do pretty well; but it would be nice to have a few special tricks up my sleeve, and to be telling the truth when I say that I have special training so I know what I&#39;m doing. (For those concerned citizens who question my right to &#39;&#39;try not to bleed so much&#39;&#39; when we&#39;re in public.)

The bad news is they are booked solid until May. That is May of 2001.

Subject:  Residential placement perspectives

The residential home might not be entirely bad. I&#39;ve got to go look for work; we need the money. With Laurel in respite care or a residential school, I could continue leading the two groups of Junior Great Books at Janet&#39;s school. And having some &#39;&#39;special time with Janet&#39;&#39; would be nice, too. 

And then maybe I could even get a bit of time in there to get a doctor to look at my aching side. The pain itself might even be persuaded to go away. That could be priceless.

But...the district is paying the piper. So Mom has no real voice in whatever they decide to do with Laurel. This person will not know her special rules, her likes and dislikes as I do. So how can we get any sort of consistency - which is what Laurel truly needs to survive here on earth. Also, Laurel is scheduled to start new meds (&#39;&#39;Anafranil, aka clomipramine*&#39;&#39;) this week. I don&#39;t like the idea of her going on meds in a strange environment, where this person is not going to know whether his behavior is better than/worse than/same as before.

And none of us can be sure if any behavioral changes are due to drugs or to change in environment. I can&#39;t see changing meds, school, and &quot;home&quot; all at the same time. Laurel just walked up to me and put her head down in my lap. Excuse me. I think we&#39;ll do some &#39;&#39;zorfs*&#39;&#39; now.

Subject:  Separate IS NOT equal!


Today, we went to check out a &#39;&#39;segregated*&#39;&#39; (read put the handicapped here) school in Lincoln County. It&#39;s about an hour minute drive each way. The school has an indoor pool and a nice playground and well-appointed therapy rooms. 

But they have only Apple IIe&#39;s, and &quot;a functional curriculum.&quot; The idea of academics for the elementary kids is gluing pinto beans to photocopied &quot;A&quot;s. My buddy Chris peeked in after I&#39;d left the classroom and said the aides were doing the craft projects anyway; none of the kids seemed to be &#39;&#39;doing anything&#39;&#39;. No work was displayed on the walls above the kindergarden level (which is the oldest class that is integrated with &quot;mainstreamable&quot; kids). She said that they did lots of community stuff:  some of the high school kids, up to age 21, were doing things like going to a store and buying one item, or going to the mall and phoning the school (with constant supervision and direction).

The psychologist and the social worker and teacher said that Laurel&#39;s &quot;behavioral issues&quot; would surely not be a problem for them, but that she would be the highest functioning student they&#39;d ever had, and they really didn&#39;t feel that she belonged there. On the other hand, they had no idea of any program anywhere in the state (or even in the country!) that would be appropriate for her.

Subject:  LaughterÑNature&#39;s way of saying what is real

Hello to all who have writtenÑmy e-mail sack grew large and I simply have not felt up to dealing with it. So this is a response to all.

My friend Mona, who&#39;s child, Brian, is autistic and preverbal, called me from Minnesota for a &#39;&#39;catharsis&#39;&#39; session. I feel much better now. I cried and sobbed and she assured me that I was reacting quite sanely to the insanity of my situation. We laughed at morose jokes. When I got the hiccups from laughing too much, she suggested I put a bag over my head (and then hastened to re-phrase that.) It was hysterical and comforting.

The funniest part, to me, was when I was telling her I&#39;ve written a note to the consumer&#39;s advocate/troubleshooter on the local news but I don&#39;t have a stamp. Why would that cause me to burst into tears? I was sobbing my heart out and laughing at myself at the same time. (Yes, we we&#39;ve been to the store a couple of times, but by the time we get to the check-out, I&#39;m not capable of asking for stamps anymore. As Mona says, &quot;I just can&#39;t think of any reason why THAT would be.&quot; This starts us both giggling and roaring and then I say &quot;Nope, neither can I. Can&#39;t think of a thing.&quot; And we are off and running again.)

We discussed, in rational voices, the relative pros and cons of simply getting Janet in the car and disappearing. (They&#39;d -have- to find someplace for Laurel then, right?) I told her that a father put his severly disabled son in the car up in Boulder a year and a half ago, drove up in the mountains and drove off a cliff. Jennie admired the ability to plan that far in advance. She has a point.

You know, the perspective of sane people is counter-productive to people in insane situations. Only another resident of Planet &#39;&#39;&quot;Special&quot;&#39;&#39; can offer any useful advice at all.

I&#39;m overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. Really. It&#39;s dropped my armor. Some of you really have sick senses of &#39;&#39;humor&#39;&#39;, which are totally appropriate.  When one is thinking in unhealthy terms, joking about unhealthy things is the only way to regain balance, if you know what I mean.  I am so glad no one has thought of tapping my phone! 

That sounds weird. You know who you are.

Subject:  Where your memories come first, to make them last

I&#39;m still so scattered I&#39;m not making much sense, but I wanted to respond to Mark&#39;s idea:  

&gt; Maybe you should have this Ms. Bradshaw b***** visit you at home
&gt;and then go shopping with you. Or rent a video camera and teach Janet
&gt;how to run it and tape some of this for her. Has she seen the
&gt;bruises and scratches? Have you called her after one of these rages?
&gt;Maybe after each and everyone of the rages? Become a pox upon her house?

Interesting notion, except then she could use that to justify keeping Laurel out of any program in the district. She could say that Laurel is a direct threat to herself and others, and &#39;&#39;lock her up for good&#39;&#39;. It would be interesting, though, to see her reaction. I don&#39;t think that she has any idea how bad this actually is. After all, I would be one of those who heals fast. Bruises barely last a week on me.  And I haven&#39;t actually gone out of my way to explain HOW violent Laurel is right now. 

This type of video would be great for blackmailing me, though. (If you demand much more, we&#39;ll show this to prospective teachers. The smart ones will turn tail and run...)

I think video tapes of rages would be good for the pshrink, and videotapes of Laurel on her good days would be great for Bradshaw, Scratcherd, Maddox and co. If you see her doing math or typing on the computer, or stretching out with the gymnastics coach, she really looks like the sweet darling little girl &#39;&#39;you want&#39;&#39; in Brownies. 

Video cameras rent for $60 per day at Waxman. =:  o

Subject:  Medical alert

Some of you guys wanted to know if Laurel is seeing a psychiatrist for meds. This, you thought, might help. I thik it might too, but we&#39;ve been trying so many so fast that I am not sure what is meds, what is outside forces, and what is just Laurel. Anyway, we&#39;ve been doing different regimes since last year. First was Anafranil  (clomipramine) then Depakote, and then the new guy recommended &#39;&#39;Lithium*&#39;&#39;, but I haven&#39;t started that yet (and haven&#39;t told the pshrink I&#39;m not doing it) because I am waiting to get the DAN! protocol and talk to the ped and the pshrink about how to progress in light of that information.  Also, I need to check with the &#39;&#39;PDR*&#39;&#39; and see if these are contraindicated for Laurel. (And I used to be such a TRUSTING soul, too!)

You guys also wanted to know if I did meds. . . maybe something is hereditary and what worked for me will work for Laurel. It is worth a shot, but meds never really helped me. A pshrink did prescribe Lithium when I was a teenager. Lithium made me walk into walls. I found that aerobic exercise and cutting the artificial crud and allergens out of my diet, and a little attitude adjustment worked better and was health-oriented instead of disease-oriented. 

I know you guys are concerned about my current state of health, and believe you me, I am too. I&#39;ve been depressed and nearly suicidal lately, but I really think that the way I feel is a &#39;&#39;rational reaction&#39;&#39; to an insane situation rather than an intrinsic thing. When your flesh and blood is &#39;&#39;determined*&#39;&#39; to make mincemeat out of you and there is no one around to help, even for a moment, it tends to get you down a bit.   

A couple of you offered some stuff, but you would be mailing it from California, and I&#39;m not altogether sure that that is legal anywhere outside of the Dream State. Further, although pot or crack might help for a very short while, it would probably mess things up in the long while. (Actually, I did coke twice as a teen, and it had no effect whatsoever. So hard drugs are probably a waste of money.)  St. John&#39;s Wort, on the other hand, or Valerian and Skullcap, these might be interesting. Anyone know of a health food store that does deliveries around here?

Thank you all for your suggestions. I have some positive directions to explore because of you.

A couple people suggested the &#39;&#39;Office of Civil Rights&#39;&#39;. One of you guys even said that they could do something fast. But I couldn&#39;t find them last year, and I have had no better luck in tracking them down this year. I think I need to hire a private eye. Or at least write to that one in the paper. I think she takes cases for free. Last year, the number was &#39;&#39;disconnected&#39;&#39; with no forwarding. 

This year, I called State Department of Education and the people I talked to had no idea what I was talking about. There was some discussion of the &quot;governor&#39;s advocate&quot;, followed by some calling back and forth across the office, (&quot;What&#39;s that lady&#39;s name? The one across the street with the brown hair. You know, what&#39;s her name.&quot; &quot;You mean the one that takes our coffee?&quot; &quot;No, I mean the one who takes those funny cases.&quot; ) before they gave me a number that turned out not to be related to education or the government.

Many of you wrote in saying that if the bureaucrats can&#39;t take it, I need to learn to take Laurel down. Or with suggestions for learning self-defense, crisis management, karate, wrestling. John, thanks for the cordial offer to teach me how to put a half-nelson on Laurel. I appreciate it. I can&#39;t get to Florida right now, but if you can come here, I can put you up. (Probably not in a wrestling hold though ;) )

I can take Laurel down ok. We can stay there indefinitely if we just stay there indefinitely, if you know what I mean. If we have to move (like, we are at the curb of Yale and Monaco, we are in the middle of Safeway&#39;s only exit, we are on the playground and the other kids and moms are getting really freaked), it gets tricky. She sometimes takes upwards of ten minutes to de-escalate.

Dungarvin, Inc., teaches Mandt humane restraint techniques. I called them last summer and left a message and we never connected. Of course, I&#39;d have to take Laurel with me, since I have no respite.

These are other things on my &#39;&#39;&quot;to do&quot; list&#39;&#39;.

Laurel&#39;s really only violent in circumstances she can&#39;t handle. If she was in a structured program and I could do my errands during the day, she&#39;d be OK.

Many of you pointed out that we only have the major blow-outs outside the house. It&#39;s so. School had them because they were stupid, like that fool gymnastics coach who felt that it was critical that Laurel not be allowed to re-trace her path back over the balance beam, even when she escalated to beating me for ten minutes (did I forget to tell you guys about that? That was Friday. It&#39;s been, like, man, one &#39;&#39;helluva trippy&#39;&#39; week.) :  -o 

It really is only in Jan/Feb when Laurel goes ballistic inside and outside the house. It could be something in the air, or maybe the short rations of sunlight, or the overabundance of carbon monoxide or gravel dust from snow sweepers, or valentines day candy, or anything. At any rate, it is something she just can&#39;t handle and it send her sailing over the edge.

But I&#39;ve decided - based on your prompting - to contact the staff at Weiland Elem (the school that thinks she is too advanced to get much good out of their program and besides is too full for her now) and see if any of the teachers or interns can sit on a weekend or in the evening.

I&#39;m also going to to contact the alternative high school and see if any of the students there are available. They get off at noon, and they all have to volunteer as part of their grad requirements. A lot of them have late-diagnosed learning disabilities and are familiar with what it is to be left out, and be angry about it, and then blamed for your anger.

I&#39;m also going to call Ms. Bradshaw, district coordinator, and ask her to sit for two hours tomorrow so I can go to the doctor to take care of the &#39;&#39;raging pain&#39;&#39; in my side and belly.  Or find someone to sit.  Or do anything.  I know she won&#39;t, I know she is still trying to get some teacher to help Laurel.  But this is an emergency that can&#39;t wait for the other emergency to settle down. 

We&#39;ll see.

Subject:  Things to do

I&#39;m still catching up with you guys. But keep the letters flowing. You don&#39;t know how much they mean to me. Again, thanks, one and all.

Anyway, a lot of you want the district&#39;s number so you can call and take action. 

It&#39;s in the Denver phone book under Cattail Creek School District. But this could be any district, any place. So I don&#39;t know if yelling at the district will do any good. At this point though, it is kind of hard to care if they get yelled at or not. If ya know what I mean &lt;;x&gt;

I was going to say something about being constructive, or. . . I dunno. I keep thinking about the mother in France who murdered her adult autistic daughter (at her daughter&#39;s request) and the way the parents kept talking about how wonderful all the professionals had been. You are all familiar with my constant second-guessing myself:  Am I being too demanding? Am I being a pushover? 

Ms. Bradshaw has a great reputation for being 100% for the kids. She&#39;s told me she loses sleep over this case. She gave me a cash settlement for the time I lost from work last academic year, and for driving Laurel to summer school when they couldn&#39;t arrange transportation. They&#39;ve spent tons of money on Laurel. 

And she is looking. Not fast enough for me, obviously, nor are they finding the people they need. And I have checked the papers and not seen any advertisements - but maybe they&#39;re advertising at the colleges or some other way that I don&#39;t see. Or maybe - and maybe I just don&#39;t want to see it - they&#39;ve decided that residential placement is THE only answer. Maybe they really aren&#39;t following up any other leads. Maybe they are just waiting for an opening - any opening. (I guess, and this is the really scary part, that that is what I would be doing &#39;&#39;if I were them&#39;&#39;).

I don&#39;t want to create something adversarial. But this is not good enough. And my &#39;&#39;paranoia*&#39;&#39; is growing by leaps and bounds every second that I don&#39;t hear from these guys. Whaddya all think? If Ms. Bradshaw&#39;s doing all she can, then I don&#39;t want to come down on her with my paranoid fantasies. I mean, this situation isn&#39;t terribly reinforcing for her as it is. Let me know if you think I&#39;m really paranoid, ok? I just can&#39;t see it for myself right now.

I&#39;m not sane yet, but I&#39;m closer to it than I was. You guys are great. That&#39;s so weak. Sorry. I&#39;ll say something profound later. Maybe much later.

Moving Laurel into a residential home &#39;&#39;in another state&#39;&#39; means:

1.)  I would have to relinquish custody so the school can declare her a ward and pay for it

2) if I move out to the state, it is no longer the school&#39;s problem so they can stop sending her there.

If I refuse to accept this, then they can say that I am &#39;&#39;willfully withholding&#39;&#39; Laurel from a proper education and can then:

1) Work with Social Services to declare me an unfit mother and take custody  (my record at Social Services already shows me as a poor risk factor)

2) Put my case on the back burner as a noncompliant mother who has sought &quot;alternative education.&quot;  (In other words, if they don&#39;t investigate, it doesn&#39;t exist. If something happens Ñwell, they simply didn&#39;t have the funds to ensure Laurel has a proper education. . . . which is illegal, but believable.)

Either way, I get knocked out.

Mind you, any arrangement we&#39;re now talking about pertains to the academic year which ends in seven weeks. Summer school and beyond? We have not begun to address these things.

Subject:  Where the *??!** is Camp Granada when you need it?


Hi guys, you and my list friends have been busy suggesting residences for Laurel - if only to give me a break. Here are some clips from the list and my responses. I guess what I&#39;m really afraid of is that the district is looking at residential only - and that for a &#39;&#39;permanent solution&#39;&#39;. 

I wouldn&#39;t be adverse to a &quot;summer camp&quot; (or &quot;spring camp&quot;) type of thing, if they would teach Laurel and me how to work together, and get Laurel ready for the real world. But that isn&#39;t what the school is looking for. Anyway, here are some snippets of ideas:  

&gt; It might make you less afraid of having Laurel be away for a while
&gt; if the goal there is &quot;A while and to return home whenever possible&quot; 
&gt;so it isn&#39;t an all or nothing scenario.

We&#39;ve had nothing but &quot;diagnostic placements&quot; for the past year and a half. Every time I agree to a &quot;temporary&quot; placement, even if I specify the goal to move quickly and assertively to a less restrictive environment, it&#39;s just a step further away from a fair, appropriate arrangement for Laurel. I just can&#39;t trust the district anymore. That sounds massively pathetic, but that&#39;s how I feel.

&gt; Please can I have Isaac&#39;s New England Center for Autism school people send you
&gt;their material. They have temporary placements - goal is to be out in three months.

Sure. Do you need my snail mail address again?

&gt; You mentioned your district would even send her elsewhere if
&gt;options weren&#39;t forthcoming. The residential school here tries very hard to keep
&gt;kids to a minimum dose of drugs and in some cases off them or not have them
&gt;on at all. There are no aversives you haven&#39;t done yourself or wouldn&#39;t try.
&gt;No painful types at all and I&#39;d be near to check if you weren&#39;t.

If they have the strength of their convictions, they&#39;re probably less likely to whap her upside the head than I am. It&#39;s not that I am pro-aversive, or less than a saint ;) it&#39;s just that I lack the physical resources to restrain or physically motivate her and I have to do things like shoving her, pulling her by the hair or under the jaw, or locking her in her room just to keep her safe. :  &lt; Now that I re-read that, it sounds really ludicrous; &quot;I had to beat her; she might have gotten hurt!&quot; (Isn&#39;t this just what your parents told you as a kid when they spanked you - this hurts me much worse than it does you? ;&gt; )

&gt; So maybe this is all babble and I&#39;m just throwing out stuff. But if we all
&gt;could send stuff your way on good schools for autism in our areas and please
&gt;be okay when I say this, preferably residential just for a while so you can rest
&gt;and get some peace and remember the brilliant, funny alter ego like the MTV

Are you suggesting that I have lost my sense of &#39;&#39;humor&#39;&#39;!? I had no idea it had gone that far! Yeah, folks, I&#39;m open. what do you know? One of my very best friends of whom I&#39;m passionately fond and whose name I can not remember at the moment (please don&#39;t take that personally; it&#39;s been a long day\\\week\\\\month) sent me a website for Margaret Anderson/Fodor, but it was really a website for a family with a young daughter who has autism, so I don&#39;t know how to contact the person she recommends.

Somebody said Judevine in St Louis. Anybody got anything on that? If you read cards or crystals, tell me that stuff, too. I need some divine intervention. I can no longer afford to wait for hindsight.

&gt;Maybe you could somehow get out of home respite or temporary
&gt;hospitalization for Laurel and bring Janet on the train or plane and even
&gt;Kodi if need be and visit NECA (Isaac&#39;s school) and me.

I would love it. I can&#39;t imagine what &#39;&#39;unscheduled alignment of planets&#39;&#39; would make it possible, but...

&gt;In all earnestness (Did I butcher the word?)
&gt;even if you never moved or move somewhere else it
&gt;might help you see what you want and don&#39;t want in a program.

Y&#39;know, that is probably the scariest thing that&#39;s happening. We are shopping for the McDonalds of programs - just anything we can get. We have completely stopped thinking in terms of evaluating Laurel&#39;s needs. When I try to remember what went on at &#39;&#39;previous IEPs&#39;&#39;, all the things I talked about are still true and none of them are being addressed. It all seems so distant now...

Anyway, we talked a while about the appropriateness of the New Jersey school. She is going to drop by pamphlets.  She gave me the &#39;&#39;URL*&#39;&#39; so that I could look it up on the web.  Naturally, I got a &#39;&#39;404 error*&#39;&#39;--there is no such page.  I think she&#39;ll simply say the server was down and will give me the URL again.  I don&#39;t think she is going to give up on this place merely because I can&#39;t find their website.

I think she felt the tiniest bit guilty, because she agreed finally that it really wasn&#39;t the mother who is being disruptive.  And if we did finally settle on New Jersey, the district would send both Laurel and me out there. The school had a dorm, so I could stay as Laurel got settled in.  (I would have to come back, because if I lived out there, then I would not live in the Colorado district, and the State of Colorado would no longer pay for Laurel to be in New Jersey.)  It is these &#39;&#39;catch-22s&#39;&#39; that she just doesn&#39;t want to seeÑor maybe that she doesn&#39;t want me to see

&quot;But my dear, don&#39;t you see how free you would be with this?&quot;  Ms. Bradshaw asked.

I told her that much freedom would kill me.  &quot;How would you like to be separated from your daughter for years at a stretch?&quot; I  asked.

&quot;Oh, sometimes I think I wouldn&#39;t mind at all.&quot; she replied, and I could just see her tossing her long black hair back from her face and smiling wryly.

I said I appreciated the gestures, but that I was still far from convinced that this was the right place for Laurel.  I wasn&#39;t at all sure about their methods of behavior modification, the fact that they could change meds any time they wanted, etc.  The usual shop talk, the pro talk, the &#39;&#39;MOM&#39;&#39; talk.

Ms. Bradshaw finally said she&#39;d look around.

 When reflected in water, the moon is a remedy for nervous &#39;&#39;hysteria&#39;&#39;.

And then interprets this as the mirror of our subconscious, as the reflected light of spiritual enfoldment.  But this modern patina does nt obscure the truth.

The moon&#39;s light on the water heals only because the water has given in to the moon.  There is no resistance, &#39;&#39;therefore there is no pain&#39;&#39;.  

But I cannot help asking, is surrender the only way to end this endless battle?  Or will the surrender itself be an act of unpardonable aggression?

Beyond the summer looms the great wall, the black unknown. If we can&#39;t even decide how to finish off the school year, how are we going to plot out Laurel&#39;s future? While all the books are off blithely touting the formative years as the crucial years, the never-say-die years, the only-time-something-can-be-done years, the schools are saying we will deal with it when she is 21.

In fact, they even offered to tack on a few weeks of a program when Laurel is 21, to magnanimously make up for what they are refusing her this year. How kind. How thoughtful of them to think that Laurel will make it to 21, or that we will put up with their abuses for another decade and more.

But things aren&#39;t really any better any place else. Every place has extremely long &#39;&#39;waiting lists*&#39;&#39;.  The school officials, the doctors, the residential home administrators grasp this knowledge in their craws. Slowly, they squash any thoughts of the future, any dread speculations on the great wall of nothing that looms beyond this school year and billows outward through &#39;&#39;the rest of our lives&#39;&#39;.

Is there really anything beyond anything? 

The wall has gripped me so tightly I cannot think. Late at night I like to imagine the other side of the moon, the other side of time when my body is no longer sprained or broken twice a day.

Anyone else would think that that would be heaven. But I have delved deep into their minds, those phantasms on the other side of anything. I know they do not feel anything, even their corpuscles are wiped clean of &#39;&#39;my memories&#39;&#39;.

Beyond anything I could not nuzzle my Laurel, feel her fine spun hair in my dreams. Beyond anything I would not know the pain of my love.

Hey, I finally found OCR! That is the Office of Civil Rights.  And I actually talked to a human being. Now is when the &#39;&#39;fun begins&#39;&#39;.

The desk is piling up with paperwork from the OCR and you are supposed to keep a log of every phone call, every thought, every nuance of every person you contact for your daughter.  This includes the &quot;that&#39;s not my department&quot; and the &quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry they referred you to us but we can&#39;t help you, you&#39;ll have to go back to them&quot; lines. You are supposed to follow up every lead you can, every clue, like a 24 hour gumshoe without any gums in his pocket.

Describe each contact.
Date of contact:
Who did you speak with?
What did they say?
What agreements were made:
        in writing
         verbally

Describe each subsequent follow up, including date, person, and action.

Describe the last incident
Date of incident:
What happened?
Who was there?
What was the &#39;&#39;aftermath&#39;&#39;?

My daughter has not been in school for the last eleven months, doesn&#39;t that mean anything? No, because you haven&#39;t done the paperwork

Subject:  Where we are going


Hi guys. Ahh what fools we mortals be when first we bother to assume. I (silly silly me) thought we were talking about Willard Home in Denver Colorado when we were talking residential placement. After all, that would be the cheapest option and I&#39;d be close enough to partake in all counseling, schooling, etc. etc.

Well guess again. Those guys can&#39;t put Laurel in a residential home in Denver because that would go against one or another or several or any of or something or other of their bleeping rules. Nooo, they are talking about a home in New Jersey, or something.

Flying Laurel out to &#39;&#39;New Jersey&#39;&#39; (though &#39;&#39;Chicago&#39;&#39;) would be a nightmare. It would be 10 hours of nonstop weirdness. And what if she goes ballistic on the plane and starts biting and hitting me? What&#39;s the pilot gonna do, pull up on the brakes, and say &quot;ok lady, you guys hit the road. I think we are half way over Nebraska&quot;??

This is so megaweird and probably bitchin illegal too. But it&#39;s the laws that got us here in the first place!!

P.S. You guys have got to tell me. Am I paranoid? Should I start bitching my head off? How do I respond? I can no longer afford to wait for hindsight.

Actually, it is a little worse than that. They want to send her to New Jersey.   There would be a conference about what our goals were, and I could stay for a few days in the guest cottage.  But then there would be no place for me.  The &#39;&#39;requisite catch-22&#39;&#39; is, of course,  if I  move out there then Laurel is no longer a client of this district and loses her placement. The contract is with the district - not with Laurel, not with me.  And visits are a recreational, family thing, so the school wouldn&#39;t pay for that.

Mother, they say, is too much of a distracting influence. The child will be a lot calmer if Mom isn&#39;t around.

I calmly pointed out, over the phone to Ms. Bradshaw that if the district actually believed this, then why did they refuse to put Laurel in school? Why did they insist that she be in my &quot;distracting&quot; company for 24 hours 7 days a week?

&quot;The district,&quot; Ms. Bradshaw informed me, &quot;has no other alternatives.&quot; 

&quot;Why was New Jersey the only choice?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Well, it is the only place that has an opening available right now.&quot; Ms. Bradshaw sniffed.

&quot;So, let me get this straight. You are telling me that you want to send my child to a school with the sole criterion being that there is an opening.&quot; My voice raised &#39;&#39;incredulously.*&#39;&#39;  &quot;Are you telling me that there is not one person in the state of Colorado who can educate my child?&quot;

&quot;Well, &#39;&#39;given the circumstances....&#39;&#39; &quot; Ms. Bradshaw&#39;s voice trailed off.

So help me I couldn&#39;t help myself. I hung up.  Again.   And this time I did not call her back.

Subject:  Thinking about New Jersey

Hello my patient loyal troopsters. And now it&#39;s time for another in the continuing stooooory of a pig that&#39;s gone to the dogs. It&#39;s PIIIIIIIGGSS INNNNNNN SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE.......

Or am I getting those two mixed up anymore? You know, you always wonder if those pigs in that chintzy spaceship ever believe they are going somewhere (even if it&#39;s not where no pig has gone before.) Do they think, &quot;yes that star looks familiar - it hasn&#39;t changed for five whole episodes&quot;? 

The reason I&#39;m asking this is (yes, Virginia, there is ALWAYS a reason) I think we have to go through Chicago to check out the New Jersey school. (Or check into the New Jersey school. One or the other. )

Of course, I am saying &quot;we&quot; here pretty darned royally.  I&#39;m not sure if the school board will pay for me to accompany Laurel, or if they are just planning on buying her a &#39;&#39;one way ticket&#39;&#39; and letting the stewardesses thrash it out.  Given the mood that all of us have been in lately, that may well be the plan.

Why am I writing this nonsense to you all at 3 am in the morning? Because I just woke up from a dream I can&#39;t even remember and tried to think of something - anything positive.  Laurel is up too, throwing her sister&#39;s teddy bear out of the window, running out  the door, picking it up, bringing it back inside, and throwing it again. I should stop here.  Any sane mother would, but I keep thinking that maybe if Laurel hears the computer going she will want to type too. . . that does seem &#39;&#39;to calm her a bit&#39;&#39;. 

Hey, I just suddenly remembered the concourse between A and B at the Chicago O&#39;Hare Airport. I went through about 10 years ago - just a bit &#39;&#39;BC*&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s some sort of modern art:

The Subject:  a dark tunnel with fluted stained glass walls, a mirrored ceiling, and bright neon tubes near the ceiling that range the rainbow - from pale yellow to bright magenta and back again. It&#39;s something Laurel would have just loved (Or may still love - I&#39;ll get us a long layover...)

If the moon took my child, it certainly would not be in the middle of Chicago O&#39;Hare Airport. There would be far too many witnesses.

Chicago is relatively sane, unlike - say - New York City. If it were La Guardia Airport, no one would see anything.

In Chicago, surely someone would go ahead and say &quot;Yeah, I saw the moon swoop down through the tunnel and snatch that lady&#39;s kid. Right, the moon had long neon colored hair and was wearing a milky white gown with green stripes. About 6 foot 4, maybe 140-150 pounds or so. Skinny bitch, the moon.&quot; 

Or at the very least, notify the &#39;&#39;proper authorities&#39;&#39;. 

And the moon would never bother the concourses again.

All I can remember from that tunnel
between concourses is the slowly changing, 
every-flashing lines of neon, &#39;&#39;mirrored into infinity&#39;&#39; 
from the ceiling.

I knew then that 
if the moon had &#39;&#39;hair&#39;&#39;
it would be these neon strands, so infinitely reflected 
in the mirrored ceiling stained silver
like the clouds basking
in the moon&#39;s stolen light.

If the moon &#39;&#39;had a voice&#39;&#39;,
then it would be these reed tones
growing into the music flowing
far from the light.

This was a long time ago, but sometimes I just know it was only the day before yesterday.  My friend (this could have been Leah, who used to keep the magic we forgot in a hidden corner on the school playground, or maybe it was Susan, who used to be Megalasourus, who was going to be a palentologist because she understood what it was to be frozen in stone) and I went off to Chicago because she had &#39;&#39;something to show me&#39;&#39;.

I&#39;m not entirely sure when or what we were doing there other than that.

My friend&#39;s sight came in only through frazzled nerves, and the blurred effect, she swore, was the only way she could show me this.  She needed me to see through her eyes. She needed someone to understand. So she lent me some weed and an old pair of glasses.

Properly blurred, we turned into the tunnel between concourses B and C of Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare Airport. There ought to be a warning posted:  The light show you are about to see could cause &#39;&#39;orgasmic understanding&#39;&#39;. Stay on the moving sidewalk. Do not look up or to the side. But this is what most people don&#39;t look around or experience anything anyway, so why bother?

The first time through, the neon threads hanging below the ceiling threatened my eyes with their infinite possibilities. So I shaded my eyes and looked only at the fluted walls:  the thick milky colors floating past. 

It probably took four trips and maybe ten more tokes before I could find the courage to stare at the ceiling, with its dragon-cache of mirrored neon rainbows. That&#39;s when I knew for sure.

It did happen. I have the ticket stub somewhere, probably in with the self-generating bunny dust under the refrigerator. But what I&#39;m wondering about now is whether it happened to me or to Laurel or to someone else entirely.

If it had been Laurel, then all that stuff about weed wouldn&#39;t be necessary. If it had been anyone else, I&#39;d have to tell you to do the Columbian gold, definitely with the seeds. Or else home grown, the kind you spray with sugar water just before you cut it.

But would it happen again if I took Laurel to New Jersey? And &#39;&#39;what am I afraid of&#39;&#39;?

The idea that the concourse between A and B in Chicago O&#39;Hare Airport is close enough to the moon that Laurel could be snatched up is ludicrous and just shows I haven&#39;t had enough sleep in way too long.

Mozart, of course, could not resist and wrote a quintet for it.

Oboe, viola, and cello flirting as always with luna and some extra bubbles for the flute.

Glass moistened at the rim and spun in orbits of overtones.

The timbre may be what invokes the moon so often. The oboe only makes one a bit strange, not &#39;&#39;totally possessed&#39;&#39;.

Ahh the early lazy days of summer vacation, when life is full of possibilities.  You could be a spelunker and find a thousand caves filled with coins of gold (or at the very least pogs of skull and pirate faces).  You could dive from heights unknown to man and land on neatly made beds. Hold it right there.  I think the neatly made beds part is a &#39;&#39;mommy fantasy&#39;&#39;, and one the kids would not appreciate.  After all, who would WANT to be the mommy during summer vacation?  

Jack Cooper came by to play with Janet at a quarter of seven in the evening.  It was still plenty light, so I said that they could go outside for a little bit.  Laurel toddled along behind them, wanting to be in on the fun.  I pulled on some shoes and followed all of them out, with my hair unbrushed and no bra.  

Laurel immediately took off for the school, and Janet and Jack followed her.  Which would have been fine, except that there was an open school board meeting going on, and the doors were unlocked. Jack, curious, threw the door open and in Laurel went, to her old room. She played on the computer, and that would have been fine, except that she decided she needed to go through the window.  This, too, would have been fine, except that someone had been revarnishing the window and it would not open all the way.  So she was stuck half way through.

I spent a good deal of time waiting for her to back out. Laurel refused to move.  Finally, I pulled her away from the outside and Janet closed the window. Unable to get back out the window, Laurel pinched me, then knocked my glasses flying along with a handful of my hair.  She grabbed a double handful of hair and pulled me to the ground, while she turned onto her back, still holding my hair, and kicked me in the face and stomach. I had to cover her mouth and nose to get her to let go. After she got up, she continued screaming, and wouldn&#39;t the school meeting happen to be getting out just then. You should have seen the looks I got from the other mothers. I&#39;m going to hear about the &#39;&#39;looks*&#39;&#39; later. 

On the way home, Janet periodically lunged for my breasts, pinching them viciously. Boy, that&#39;s effective. I jumped around her and walked on ahead, and she followed. She was pretty much calm by the time we got home. I made her go to her room anyway.

 She was mad, and screamed and beat on the doors. Her hands were tattered shreds of skin by the time she was calm enough for me to go in.

I don&#39;t think the Anafranil is working. Her &#39;&#39;OCD*&#39;&#39; has escalated since she&#39;s been on it, and her aggression increased this past week. The psychiatrist &#39;&#39;raised her dosage&#39;&#39;. 

But I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t know what to do. The thing is, it&#39;s mostly these breaks in structure that precipitate the problem, so I don&#39;t think there would be such a problem in a highly structured environment. How do you explain the summer vacation? Especially when the last time she was out was the long &quot;break&quot; in the middle of last year as the school couldn&#39;t get its act together to save its ass.

I try for a consistent home schedule. We attempt to wake up at the same time, do exercises at the same time, etc. But it is nowhere near what she can get in a school, with bells, other classes, and all the frenetic yet ordered activities.

Face it, I can&#39;t guarantee a constant, consistent, highly structured environment outside of school. The boundaries are too vague to really set anything up. Further, the outside errands (grocery shopping, gas, etc.) are low structure, high random events. Going for a walk is a vague sort of thingÑeven if you do it at the same time each evening. And that&#39;s when most of the aggression is happening.

I guess what I really want is to abolish summer vacations, weekends, and any other stray aberrations from the schedule.

Feedback guys?

By her third birthday, Laurel had been screaming practically nonstop for ten months. Her vocabulary consisted of:

¤ a high, keening note which meant &#39;&#39;she wanted something&#39;&#39;: a bottle, a wheel from the Big Wheels toy car to spin, a clean diaper, a piece of moonlight on the wall. Something, anything. I was never sure what.  

¤ a dark, low scream that signified pure terror.  I learned to recognize the symptoms and &#39;&#39;causes of fears&#39;&#39;:  the front door, a piece of paper, my hands, running water. Everything, anything became &#39;&#39;the enemy&#39;&#39; to be slain through her voice.

¤ a ceaseless scale of sound like an operatic banshee that went from a low moan to an inaudibly high squeal.  This was &#39;&#39;the ultimate air raid&#39;&#39; that kept everything else at bay and was used whenever the other two were not enough to &#39;&#39;convey her soul&#39;&#39;.

Janet&#39;s birth was much easier than Laurel&#39;s had been.  Janet politely signalled with even spaced pains, waited patiently for the ambulance, and made her appearance just under a half an hour after I was prepped.   No complications there, and I brought her home quickly.

The Catholic charity sent out ten girls in a row to help when Janet was born.  They would stream into the house, carrying oversize suitcases of blowdryers, torn jeans, and oversize sweatshirts.  They would stream back  out of the house carrying earplugs and clutching rosaries.  One lasted two hours.  Another 5 minutes. After a while, the girls stopped coming.

Janet and I learned to &#39;&#39;live around the sounds&#39;&#39; of Laurel&#39;s screams.

I tried everything I could to handle Laurel&#39;s screams.  She had &#39;&#39;no words&#39;&#39;, no other language to communicate her anguish.  After she had cried nonstop for over a month, I made an appointment with Doctor Jacobsen, the pediatrician the insurance company recommended.  I told the nurse I wanted to speak with the doctor over the phone first.  She sounded a bit odd as we made the phone appointment, but Dr. Jacobsen called on the dot and did not flinch at the background of screams.  He said to bring her &#39;&#39;in after hours*&#39;&#39; so no one else would be disturbed.  I thanked him.

When we got there, he took his time.  Slowly Laurel accepted the stethoscope he had warmed in his hand.  He listened for gas, for breathing, for heartbeats.  Tested her reflexes.  Felt for any tender areas.  Held her carefully and told her that he was going to draw blood.  Laurel never stopped her scaled screaming, but she never modulated into the &#39;&#39;tones of terror&#39;&#39; either.  

After making notes, we set up a phone appointment for the results.  He called back, promptly on the dot with the news that nothing seemed to be out of place physically.  We talked about the asymptomatic weeks that had led up to this sudden onset, the slow development beforehand. I had not realized that at fifteen months Laurel should have been able to speak a few words, understand and comply with complex directions like &quot;turn off the tv&quot; or &quot;come into the living room.&quot;   Laurel had done none of these things.  She had seemed content to lie in her crib, staring at her iridescent mobile of the cow, the fork, and the spoon jumping over the moon.

He asked if there had been anything emotional that might be causing this, any outside stress.  I told him, there had been some marital difficulties, and actually my husband had left for good the week before this and probably wasn&#39;t coming back. 

He asked if this final breaking point was from the child&#39;s screaming.  I said, no, there had been &#39;&#39;other issues&#39;&#39;, too.

He said there wasn&#39;t much he could do and recommended we both see a psychologist.  Gave me some sleeping pills, and nodded when I said I couldn&#39;t take them - there was &#39;&#39;no one to watch&#39;&#39; Laurel while I slept.  Gave Laurel some children&#39;s aspirin just on the off chance it might be physical.

When I got back to town, I rushed over to the Oak Ridge Institute and demanded to see my daughter. I had to talk with her, if only to make reparations for my poor mothering behind glass, like a prisoner apologizing for her sins, touching the glass as if it were the fingers of the one she has murdered.

I was led into a small cement waiting room, with a demarcation line painted firmly on the concrete - white on the top and a dark khaki underneath, as if this stark contrast was all that was needed to fend off the ill winds of feeblemindedness (or whatever terms they were using at the moment).  I opened the door, waiting.  A nurse in a white cap shuffled back over the yellowed linoleum tiles and brought out a limp bundle, wrapped tightly against the cold.  She carried her bundle stiffly, arms outstretched, hands clawing in like the rails on a crib - there only to keep things from falling out of line.  

She placed the bundle on the seat beside me.  I opened it slowly, lifting the face from the edges of the starched white sheets.   A thin parody of Laurel&#39;s face lay in the depths of the cloth, her image smudged with silence, with tears.   I could not tell if the tears were mine or hers.   She opened her eyes, struggled to get her arms free of the sheets, and held onto my hand.  Her arm clenched mine, her face still impassive, still unmoving.  I held her.

She struggled free, still silent.  Walked over to the door and started to pound on it with her fists.   I opened it.  She walked out into the hallway, tugging at my arm in the way she always did to lead me to whatever it was she wanted.  I followed.  We went to the front desk, where she pounded her way along the railing. Over to the double front doors, which she pounded.  I stopped her, showed her how they opened outwards.  She stepped through and pounded the sidewalk.  Dropped my hand, ran over to the car, and pounded on the passenger side.  We left.  

I called later, explaining what had happened, and told them we would not require their services.  Naturally, there was a lot more to it than that.  This was the first of the many &#39;&#39;Social Service&#39;&#39; visits, explanations, and reports.  But I don&#39;t want to get into that right now.

Only the pale shadows of things survived outside of the words written in the moon&#39;s blood.  Dimly, the shadows sensed that they were not what they had once been, and the shadows wrote their own words of a golden age which none of them could remember.

The moon read their words and wept.  

Seeing the &#39;&#39;shadows&#39; longing&#39;&#39;, the moon tried to make things right. She erased part of a scroll, the one that talked of the ways people understood the universe, conversed with the stars, and kept faith with themselves and the animals. But as she erased the words, these things were not strong enough to reappear in the world, and so they fell out of existence altogether.

The moon tried to breathe life into the words. But the words had lost the ability to breathe with her. They stared, lifeless, on the page.

And the moon could not reach them in their &#39;&#39;tombs*&#39;&#39;.

I put Laurel in the Oak Ridge Institute on a &quot;trial basis.&quot;  Dr. &#39;&#39;Graybill&#39;&#39; got around the waiting list by saying it was an emergency, temporary placement.  We would find the way to pay the bills somehow.  Dad said it was the best thing for all of us and presented me with a &#39;&#39;prepaid hotel stay*&#39;&#39; at the Red Mountain Inn in Glenwood Springs.

Janet and I stayed  for six glorious days.  I called the Oak Ridge Institute twice a day, asking about Laurel. They said she was fine, that she was doing well, and had stopped screaming about thirteen hours after I left.  They said she was eating. They said she was not making eye contact, but that would come in time.

I took some of the time for myself.  I had a shower that was over an hour long, treated myself to a hot oil treatment, an actual hair cut, and long sessions in the two olympic size pools of natural hot springs.  As I lay in the hot water and looked up at the newly green mountains, I wondered if I should have done this a long time ago.  After all, I told myself, the experts did in thirteen hours what you failed to do in thirteen months.  Maybe I really am a bad influence on my daughter.  Maybe I did cause this.

I looked over each of my actions with a magnifying glass for the &#39;&#39;seed crystal&#39;&#39;, the action I could hold up and say, this was the catalyst. This was the cause of the whole thing.  Had she heard our whispered fights?  Had I tried to toilet train her too soon? Given up too soon? Was it being pregnant with Janet? Had I rubbed my belly where she could see me? Breast fed her too long?  Not long enough?  Fed her the wrong breakfast cereal?  My mind raced faster than the wind in the pine trees.   The bubbles streaming up from the chair as I lay there did nothing to calm my nerves.

Dr. Jacobsen tried antibiotics, then taking her off all solid foods and rotating from one formula to another until we&#39;d covered every brand on the market.  He had me giving her enemas twice a week, until she turned up anemic.  Nothing worked.  

At his insistence, we went to a psychiatrist, Dr. &#39;&#39;Graybill&#39;&#39;, a sweet lady who each session first drank a full diet Doctor Pepper and then smoked four Virginia Slims, using the empty can as an ashtray.  Laurel was fascinated by the way the ash settled into the rim of the can and would tip the can slightly to see how far the ash would move.  At first, I tried to prevent this, but Dr. Graybill smiled and explained that she wanted to see how Laurel reacted on her own.  I smiled back and relaxedÑas much as we could.  Laurel started with her frightened moaning but gradually relaxed into her scaled screaming.  I rocked Janet and talked over the screams, telling her how lonely I&#39;d been, how difficult it was to see anyone, how no one would stay to help and how I could not find &#39;&#39;the resources I needed&#39;&#39; to survive.

She asked me how I was making it, and I said, one second at a time.  She asked why I hadn&#39;t sought help, and I showed her the file.  She asked why I hadn&#39;t simply let Laurel go into an institution where they could help and I told her Laurel needed me, that I hadn&#39;t seen &#39;&#39;an institution&#39;&#39; that could help.  She asked me if I had &#39;&#39;looked very hard*&#39;&#39;.  

We went for four sessions, each a month apart.  At each session, I showed her the results of my searches, the societies, the doctors I had called, the bills I had not been able to pay.  I told her I could not pay her bill, either, that we would have to work something out.  

On the fourth session, Dr. Graybill said she had the answers.  All Laurel and I needed was a break from each other, she said. 

A short vacation for both of us would do &#39;&#39;wonders*&#39;&#39;.  I could sleep, catch up on my humanity.  Laurel, freed from my grasp, could become normal.

And she had found the very place. Oak Ridge Institute would take Laurel on a trial basis, just so we could have the breathing space we needed.  I was too tired to do anything but agree.

This is Laurel&#39;s recipe:  

 In a medium bowl, stir in two cups of water, three tablespoons cornstarch, and a quarter cup Dawn dishwashing detergent. 

 Swirl gently. Dip hands in and blow.

 Catch the sunlight if you can. Keep trying if you cannot. 
 Eat the Sunlight when you have it.

I am not sure if it is lunch or bubbles. She eats it anyway. And seems fine for the moment. I join her. The soap &#39;&#39;sunlight&#39;&#39; is almost tangy, almost a darkened silver.

Moonstones know they are the moon&#39;s &#39;&#39;shattered bones&#39;&#39;. They know what the moon has forgotten to tell even herself. They know that I whisper in Laurel&#39;s ear she is my sweet moonchild. They know that sometimes I tiptoe over to Laurel and lay my head next to hers on the pillow, listening for her breath.

How long will it take, I wonder, for them to call the moon back and tell her where her moonchild is? I shudder at my thoughts. 

At night I lie awake, too exhausted for sleep. I watch the moon as she steals back across my bedroom window.

This was the first time that someone had asked me to take Laurel in when no one else would be around.  It was far from the last. I speculated on the motives behind this:

*   Good policy--it is easier on Laurel when no one is around and the doctor can see her in more &quot;normal&quot; circumstances.

* Good timing--Laurel can take up far more time than a normal child, so seeing her at the end of the day will not make everyone else wait.

*   Good business--who would want to go to a doctor who has screaming, uncured children in his waiting room?

All the same, in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about segregation.  Do we have &#39;&#39;unofficial&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Jim Crow laws&#39;&#39; for the disabled?

I hoped we might come up with some novel way of thinking about Laurel. 

Dr. Jacobsen finally suggested, &quot;Perhaps Laurel is &#39;&#39;not really in pain&#39;&#39;.  Perhaps she &#39;&#39;merely perceives*&#39;&#39; that she is in pain.&quot;

Well. &#39;&#39;Isn&#39;t that novel&#39;&#39;?

We know them.
The deep red fullness of the moon&#39;s body clings to me.

You, with your endlessly changing faces, your silvering but never aging body, are the mother to the fates. Virgin, mother, crone all spin their entrails and cut their threads from your template.

I understand this. I see you so clearly, the full eye between clouds that change from laughing lights to burning dragons in a heart&#39;s moment. Now that I have divined &#39;&#39;your secret&#39;&#39;, I can only ask once again, knowing this time you will hear me:  

Give her back.

Hello again.  This is definitely one of those times when I hope that this message finds you in much better shape than it left me.  Hope your holiday preparations are going well, festivities and joyous celebrations planned and executed with all deliberate joy and goodwill of the season.

As for this home front, things are a bit warped.  I think we will put off celebrating anything for a while, and wait until Laurel calms down a wee bit.   Laurel has been moody all day (?)  all week! all month!  &#39;&#39;Winter break*&#39;&#39; confuses Laurel - she has dressed herself, grabbed her books, and stood waiting for the bus every day this week.  She will wait on the corner for as long as I let her and then pushes away as I lead her inside.

Stomping her foot and shaking her whole body, she will retreat to a corner and mutter.  I explained that this was Winter break, that it was temporary and she would be going back to school soon.  Janet tried to play school with her, going over the workbooks and giving out starbursts for just being there. I dragged out the materials we had had so much luck with this summer and tried to get Laurel interested in putting the banana card over the banana, the walrus card over the stuffed walrus.  None of this worked.  Laurel just put her hands over her ears and hummed at us.  Even the muppets have lost their appeal.

This morning, I tried one more time to get her interested in &#39;&#39;her comm book&#39;&#39;.  I took out the paper and cut out icons (a Christmas tree and a &#39;&#39;pine wreath&#39;&#39;) that I thought she might like.  Something new, something different.  This was, of course, a massive mistake.  When I put the icons on the &quot;This is what is going to happen now&quot; page, Laurel freaked. Her eyes grew big, her mouth puckered in on itself, and she started to rock.

Needless to say, we did not go out for a tree.  Janet had already brought out the ornaments, and Laurel took each ornament and carefully smashed it against the window.   I tried to stop her, holding her in my arms and pressing against her belly.  She wriggled free and started her keening screaming.  I tried to tie her down, but she struggled too hard for me to get a good grip and leave a hand free to restrain her.  Janet grabbed the comm book and shoved it at Laurel.  With her hand covered in &#39;&#39;blood and glass shards&#39;&#39;,  Laurel  grabbed the comm book from my hands and started tearing it.  Blood covered every bit of the pages.  When she found she could not tear the fabric and velcro of the book itself, she pushed me aside, wrenched open my desk, and pulled out the scissors.  Her hands were still full of glass shards, but she stabbed the book with the scissors until nothing was left but rags.

Then she ran into her room and locked the door.  I could still hear her wailing hours later, her hands still pounding on the door.

I stayed on the other side of the door for those hours, slumped over.  There was nothing else I could do.  

She came out about a half hour ago.  The skin on her hands was shredded, and there were several long bruises on her arm. But the blood had dried.  We took a shower together and I cleaned up as much of the wounds as I could.  I thought about going in to the emergency room, but I don&#39;t think either of us can handle that at this point.

Subject: Walking a mile in the other guy&#39;s army boots

Reading a really depressing book right now, which just about fits my mood. I&#39;ve actually been reading it for the past month or so.  When I can. I picked it up because of the title, Children with Emerald Eyes: Histories of Extraordinary Boys and Girls. I would like to think that Laurel is not alone, that the emerald green of her eyes means something to someone. Any way, before I get too awfully maudlin, I wanted to show you what I found on page 197. The author has spent the time up till now teaching autistic and developmentally disabled kids, and has just taken one, Danny, home for a month.  Here is her report back:  

&quot;Then I learned to have respect for the parents of such children. To live with these kids is at times beyond the &#39;&#39;realm of imagination&#39;&#39;. It is at times a test of human endurance. And at times a ripping of one&#39;s guts, a tearing of one&#39;s frazzled nerves. 

It was then that I learned, at least a tiny bit, what the parents of these children go through.

It was then I learned what it means &#39;&#39;not to have a life&#39;&#39; of one&#39;s own.

It was then that I learned some compassion for parents. It was then that I learned some humility.

And for that I shall always be grateful to Danny and his parents.&quot; (page 197)

See?? Someone understands at least a little. But only because she had to care for Danny (an autistic boyÑor rather &quot;a whirly fleeting thing that was a boy&quot; (p. 158)). She had only a month of this never-ending-life-sucking mania, and she wrote that. Cool. Wonder what I would write if I could have time to write.

Because I am such a nice person (and I may want to find this book again: it is a library book and I wouldn&#39;t mind it being on my shelf, hint, hint) here is the other info you might need:

Dateline:   Too tired to care

Towering in the sink are bowls and more bowls crusted with oatmeal, pea soup, spaghetti-o&#39;s.  Papers for Laurel&#39;s IEP, her meds, her therapy litter the floor. Bills spill over from my desk onto old dog droppings Laurel brought in from somewhere. I would scream but then Laurel would join in and we would never stop.  

I cannot remember how Hercules cleaned the Aegean stables.  I seem to recall something about a maiden crooning to him, singing while floods cleared the stench of a thousand years.  He has a nice relaxing day, wakes up refreshed, and claims his reward.

I want &#39;&#39;someone to croon&#39;&#39; for me.  I cannot croon for myself.

My mattress smells like dog barf. I want a double bed, with a frame, and bedding...

&#39;&#39;Laurel&#39;s hand&#39;&#39; is infected.

I haven&#39;t had my hair done in over a year and it looks it.

The world is a shitty place. And my kitchen is the epicenter of cruddiness.
There are moldy spaghetti stains on the wallpaper.
 Really.

I have an attitude problem.

I wish I could just go to sleep and wake up to something else.

Thus are we powerless before her.  Thus we go out as we came in.  This is the terror in the necronomicons, this the hidden horror under the instructions to turn three times in the moonlight and say our Ave Marias and &#39;&#39;paternosters&#39;&#39; backwards.

Nothing would hold the words of the moon but the moon herself. She tore open her skin and dribbled her hands into her flesh. 

 She drew the ink from &#39;&#39;her own blood&#39;&#39;, still heavy from giving birth to the entire universe. 

She made her pen from &#39;&#39;her own hair&#39;&#39;, long and silver strands that rested on the sea, billowing with the breath of the waves. 

The parchment she stretched from her &#39;&#39;own fair skin&#39;&#39;, sacrificing swaths of her thin covering, revealing the bone-white stones beneath.

Thus she made ready to write.

Subject: Water in the desert


LIke Helen, we wish to announce an epiphany. This has been an incredible summer, but once more, Houston, we have &#39;&#39;contact!&#39;&#39; We have lift off! Lemme explain. Last night, I went to a Facilitated Communication Workshop put on by the Colorado Chapter of the Autism Society of America. When I got home, I told Laurel I&#39;d found a great way for us to communicate. I would learn to help her and we&#39;d be able to talk to each other. She could ask me questions and tell me what she wanted.

She immediately began to make more direct eye contact, smile, and respond to my voice. She hummed loudly and began to rock with my hand. I got her desk and chair and put a photocopy of an IntelliType keyboard in front of her. I said, (text-colour:navy)[&quot;Come here and sit down.&quot;] And she came right over and sat by me, her hand searching for mine again. I asked her to find (text-colour:navy)[&quot;A,&quot;] holding my right hand over hers to isolate her index finger. 

Laurel pushed the power button several times, but I told her it was just a &#39;&#39;paper copy&#39;&#39; and if this worked we would get a real one. I said again, (text-colour:navy)[&quot;Find A.&quot;] Her finger hovered gently over the left of the center row (where A would be on a computer keyboard). Janet was hovering too, wanting to get in on this new type of game. (text-colour:red)[&quot;You&#39;re so slow Laurel,&quot;] she said and grabbed Laurel&#39;s hand, dragging it over to the (text-colour:red)[&quot;A.&quot;]

After a short break, I asked Laurel to spell her name. She pushed &quot;L.&quot;  I praised her and put an orange starburst on the keyboard by L.  She typed (text-colour:green)[&quot;LA&quot; &quot;LA&quot; &quot;LA&quot;] and vocalized (text-colour:green)[&quot;LO, LO, LO&quot;] (which when you say the first sylable of her name makes a certain amount of sense. I wonder what she makes of phonics!). Then, wonder of wonders, she smiled and looked at me. I said, (text-colour:navy)[&quot;Okay, now &#39;U.&#39;&quot;] and she pressed &quot;UR&quot; and said, &quot;LOR.&quot; After about a minute, she pressed &quot;LLLLLLLLLLL&quot; and sang, quite clearly, &quot;Peanut, peanut butter.&quot; She pushed back the desk and ran over to the refrigerator. She said, &quot;wa, wah,&quot; and then said &quot;peh, peh.&quot; I got out the Pepsi, but she really wanted a grape popsicle.

She flopped on the couch as if exhausted, and Janet went to croon over her. But Laurel kept returning to the desk and her paper. She pressed &quot;L&quot; and several other letters. I facilitated. She left after a few minutes and I did not pursue it. 

Before bed that evening, Laurel had &#39;&#39;said more&#39;&#39; than she had said all summer: &quot;dog,&quot; &quot;I want,&quot; &quot;shower,&quot; and even &quot;good.&quot; (she had never before attempted &quot;good&quot; needless to say, I was thrilled). She made unusually direct and frequent eye contact and appeared happy and excited. She even &quot;ahhhed&quot; along when Janet sang &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; at bedtime.

A good night was had by all.

Subject: When did you know? 

Somebody on the autism list asked the subject question. One mother remembered thinking, &quot;If I just love her more, she&#39;ll love me back.&quot; Here&#39;s a copy of my answer. 

Laurel was born in June 1987, a couple of months after Psychology Today had this big anniversary issue covering the life cycle. It stated that a baby only a few days old would imitate facial expressions. So when I brought Laurel home from the hospital, I made faces at her. She&#39;d smile and giggle but never made any attempt to imitate me. I thought this was odd. I mentioned it to a doctor, who sarcastically said, &quot;Well, I would believe everything you read in Psychology Today.&quot; 

Laurel was so terrified of the blow dryer and vacuum cleaner noises that I didn&#39;t use them at all; I put thrift store sheets down on the floor, gathered and washed them when they got dirty. She could work the VCR and stereo independently since she was able to crawl. She didn&#39;t like the music I selected (Beethoven, classic rock) but kept tuning in a country station which I hate! At one year, Laurel was playing peek-a-boo with everything like she invented the game. She never spoke, but she would stay up for hourse in the night, playing &#39;&#39;peek-a-boo with the moon&#39;&#39;.

But she didn&#39;t reach to be picked up, &#39;&#39;speak*&#39;&#39; any words clearly, point or wave, and she had no discernible word for &quot;&#39;&#39;mama.&#39;&#39;&quot; I remember commenting to someone that babies were said to be loving, but really, at that age, they just saw parents as tools to deliver food and warmth and entertainment. Children just develop at different rates, my pediatrician said. 

At seven months, Laurel was riding on my shoulders and accidentally scratched my eye. Tthe opthalmologist flipped a console switch that lit up a toy monkey in the corner. This was supposed to keep her occupied and quiet while he looked at my eye. The monkey chittered and banged cymbals. Laurel didn&#39;t look. The doctor switched the monkey off and on again. Laurel looked at the switch. The doctor did not say anything, but I could hear him thinking that something was not right with this child. 

Laurel was &#39;&#39;&quot;kicked out&quot; of day care&#39;&#39; when she was 26 months old. One day, she simply started screaming. And didn&#39;t stop screaming for about two years. We went to Dr. Jacobsen, who at first put it down to colic, then said it couldn&#39;t be that bad. Then he sent me to a psychiatrist, Dr. Graybill, who convinced me to put Laurel away for a week at Oak Ridge Institute, just to get &quot;Mom&#39;s&quot; head in the right space.  Obviously, the  problem was a faulty mother/child bonding and &#39;&#39;going away&#39;&#39; would simply fix the problem. I was so desperate for anything that I did this. I came back nine days later to a silent stranger. And I walked out of there with her in my arms. Surely anything I did was better than sucking the soul out of her. This was a disaster.  But seeing Laurel crushed that way gave me the strength to stand the noise. We got used to it and called it normal. I could not get a job, nor leave the house.  I got back together with Laurel&#39;s father, and things were semi-ok for about two days.

About nine months later, Laurel&#39;s sister Janet was born. Not only did Laurel keep on screaming, but she refused to change any of her ways. Laurel simply didn&#39;t recognize Janet in any way, shape, or form. I mean, Janet might as well have been a shoe. She didn&#39;t step on her, but neither did she acknowledge the baby in any way. (text-colour:red)[&quot;Sibling rivalry, of course,&quot;] my friends said. (text-colour:navy)[&quot;Yeah, just like marriage is necrophilia,&quot;] I said. They didn&#39;t get the joke. If there was one. 

I took Laurel to pediatricians, audiologists, neurologists, psychologists, etc. The audiologist said that results were inconclusive. Three pediatricians said, Wait and see. The neurologist said it was a worried mother syndrom and suggested I see a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists ranged from schizophrenic to severly retarded (and their diagnoses went with them)--Badump. Ching.

I arranged for Laurel to be in an extraordinary day care led by the wife of the principal of the demonstration school (the public school that tries out new curriculum and teaching techniques). Laurel simply didn&#39;t see the adults or other kids. She might hold onto someone as she maneuvered the step into the back yard, but it was as if they were objects and not people. While the other children colored or listened to stories, Laurel played with the dishwasher and the vertical blinds. When I came to pick her up, she never heard me. I would call for her at the door and continue calling for her as I walked through the house, until I was standing right next to her. Eventually, she would look up, and her face would fill with joy. 

Yet at home, she would come running in from the bedroom when the opening music of her favorite video played ever so softly. And when I hummed to her, she&#39;d match my tone. I took her to an audiologist. She was diagnosed, &quot;not deaf.&quot; Wait and see. I took her to a pediatric neurologist. Laurel was again diagnosed &quot;not deaf. Does not play appropriately with toys.&quot; But I couldn&#39;t find work and the divorce played havoc with our finances. When Laurel was three and a half, I made an appointment with the Children&#39;s Hospital&#39;s speech and language lab for evaluation. 

My Dad said, &quot;Fine, do it your way,&quot; rolled his eyes. This is my &#39;&#39;Dad&#39;s way of saying&#39;&#39; that whatever I am doing is idiotic and any fool can see that. So I said, &quot;No. If you&#39;ve got something to say to me, say it.&quot; He told me that Laurel was not just delayed in speech; the way she related to people, the way she played, even the way she looked at things were different. 

I called Children&#39;s Hospital and asked for a more complete evaluation. After two weeks of testing (optical, audio, OT, PT, SLP, psych workups, genetics, fragile X, blood, urine, I don&#39;t know what all), Dr. &#39;&#39;Mollie O&#39;Malley&#39;&#39; (doesn&#39;t that sound like a Dr. Seuss character?) sat across a table from me and, with eyes moist with concern, somber face and halting voice said, &quot;Did you ever think it might be. . . autism?&quot; I was in shock. Dr. Malley recommended I see Dr. Kathleen Frawley for a second opinion. So a few days later, we went to see Dr. Frawley. 

Laurel didn&#39;t want to draw dots and circles. She wanted the necklace on Kathleen&#39;s neck, and she grabbed for them nearly choking the good doctor. Kathleen silently handed over the string of bright yellow beads, and Laurel lowered them slowly up and down, just at the edge of her vision. Kathleen said, &quot;Yep, she&#39;s autistic.&quot; And she might as well have been saying, &quot;She&#39;s two&quot; or &quot;She has brown eyes.&quot; And that quickly, I realized that autism was just a word; it meant what I believed it meant. Life-consuming tragedy or just another trait and Laurel was still the same sweet, beautiful little girl she was before I&#39;d ever heard that word.

Subject: Manna on the ground

Chris and I have been working nonstop with Laurel--almost around the clock. Like a chimerical butterfly, she goes from comm book to facilitated typing sessions to workbook to calm walks to the gas station. This has been the most &#39;&#39;fantastic summer&#39;&#39; I have ever had.

I got the Intellitype facilitated communication keyboard and program and hooked it into my Mac, and we have been using it every day. At first, Laurel was upset when she made a mistake (either in typing or capping or spacing. Everything had to be perfect, and if she hit the wrong key, then she would howl and keen and rush off to bang her head against the refrigerator. We never got an entire word out.  Finally, today, Chris played facilitated typing with Janet, and Janet (having been coached very carefully ahead of time) made several mistakes. Each time Janet made a mistake, she said &quot;ok, hit delete, hit delete&quot; and would make a BIG deal of going over to the &#39;&#39;delete*&#39;&#39; key, with Chris&#39; hand supporting her finger. 

Laurel watched this from the kitchen out of the corner of her eye, wary of these people who were in her space, taking up her talking board. Then she rocked very carefully and deliberately, holding Chris&#39; hand and pressing nonexistent keys on the refrigerator. After Chris got her a grape popsicle, Laurel put the popsicle on top of the monitor and grabbed Chris&#39; hand.

They started to type. I didn&#39;t even dare to rescue the monitor from sure stickiness. Laurel typed in &quot;i&quot; then hit the delete key and held down the cap lock for &quot;I&quot; then released the cap lock and typed in &quot;lov3e&quot;. Went back and erased the &quot;3&quot; and the &quot;e,&quot; made it &quot;love&quot; and went on for the &quot;you.&quot; When she had this, she tried to take up the grape popsicle (but this had melted into the computer long before). She howled. I gave her a new popsicle, and she touched the back of my hand, blowing into my face. Chris stood back and watched. The tears in all our faces were just &#39;&#39;too much to bear&#39;&#39;. So we put the swing icon on the &quot;This is what is going to happen now&quot; page in Laurel&#39;s comm book and went out into the sunshine.

Subject: Validation/Valid-diction.

Hey gang. We had Laurel&#39;s first &#39;&#39;IEP&#39;&#39; (Individualized Education Plan) meeting of the year. Nope, they haven&#39;t actually hired the teachers, yet, but they are playing telephone tag as we speak. Nope, they don&#39;t actually have a room yet, but we may be able to convert one of the storage closets on the lower level. I asked them for something better. They said they&#39;d try. I&#39;m gonna look into a trailer and a space heater. Not that anyone should confuse the two.

Yet, for the first time in a long time, I came away from an IEP meeting higher than a kite! No, they didn&#39;t snort anything there, you silly people with your so-eager-to-corrupt-little-minds. (Although, as a total aside, they really should. . these meetings are worse than a incompetent phlebotomist digging inside your vein, barely missing your soul, and all the while asking, well, MOM, have you stopped irrevokably harming your child yet?)

And then they wonder why we get so annoyed sometimes. Anyway, I am soaring high because they actually crawled out of their &#39;&#39;tiny comfy mind shells&#39;&#39; and did something right for once!

Anyway, the good news is (And there actualy is a lot of good news at least as far as I am concerned, thrilling news, and I should probably let you have it without all this build up, but I like the theatrics...)

DRUM ROLL PLEASE

We actually convinced them to do facilitated typing. On my rusty old MacClassic. Isn&#39;t this incredible? To actually convince a school professional to try something a little new? We must be doing something right in their eyes. 

I gave them the whole background, carefully explaining the theories behind what &#39;&#39;Chris&#39;&#39; and I have been doing this summer. Our nonstop work has paid off in spades. and trowels. and flowers. The comm book is almost, but not quite, the natural order of things. (I will make a comm book for the school so we can both have one Hooray for consistency!) 

We&#39;ve been stimming (repeating Laurel&#39;s spinning, or head nodding) along with Laurel just to provide a safe atmosphere. (They will not be doing this as it reinforces negative socializaton behavior patterns. Hooray for inconsistency!)

Then we told them about the facilitated typing we started. We have progressed rapidly from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;I wanna Pepsi&quot; and now onto some truly interesting stuff. Laurel almost says &quot;I wanna&quot; and then types. Then she says &quot;Stop&quot; and ends. Almost always on a period. With incredible grammar. And very few typing errors usually just hitting a key next to the one she wanted. She will go back and hit the delete key, and retype she seems to be fastidious about this.

I showed the school her latest one today. They were convinced I&#39;d done it. And were wondering about my medication. But Chris swore on a stack of &#39;&#39;Bibles*&#39;&#39; that this really did work. We showed the old ones to demonstrate Laurel&#39;s typing progress. They said no one could learn that fast. So I said, (text-colour:navy)[&quot;OK. Why don&#39;t we do the exercise just because it is something she likes to do and one of the few things she&#39;ll sit still for for 20 minutes at a time? We can call it a reading readiness exercise or something.&quot;] They said, &#39;&#39;ok*&#39;&#39;. Hooray for peace and quiet! 

So they wrote up their own rationale. Which is just fine with me. Hey, whatever works, works.

Subject: Another thing I just thought of 

 I think I&#39;ve told you this one before. But I hold it to my face like the beloved edge of a soft blanket, worn thin with companionship.

My dad, who doesn&#39;t talk much (he prides himself on being &quot;stoic&quot;), suggested that Laurel&#39;s behavior problems (like her grandmother and probably mother) are largely due to her being spoiled. He thinks I let &#39;&#39;Laurel get away&#39;&#39; with more than I would an ordinary kid, because she&#39;s disabled. 

The fact of the matter is that decades of research have shown that paying attention to undesirable behaviors reinforces them. Punishment may seem like the reasonable thing to do, but really, it just makes the behaviors more durable, and increases the child&#39;s tolerance of punishment. Especially in a case where the child simply has no other way of expressing needs, punishing bad behaviors quickly erodes the child&#39;s self-esteem (The child sees it as, &quot;You have no right to protect yourself. You have no right to express yourself.&quot;) which leads to a host of other problems, such as mistrust, SIBs (self-injurious behaviors), low frustration tolerance, and unwillingness to try new things. I can point you to Lovaas or Durand or any number of other respected scientists to back that up. So it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t done my homework. 

OTOH, I can hardly say that I&#39;m doing an acceptable job, in light of her &#39;&#39;continued behavior problems&#39;&#39;, so I can&#39;t afford to dismiss anybody&#39;s suggestions out of hand. And besides, he&#39;s my dad; any criticism from him makes me feel like a stupid six year old playing at grown-up. (Which makes sense, because &#39;&#39;when they divorced&#39;&#39; when I was six, he said to me, &quot;So now you&#39;re the grown up in the family. Behave like one!&quot;)

So, we&#39;re over at Dad&#39;s house a couple of years ago, and Laurel thwumps Janet over the head with her fist. I can&#39;t remember now just why. And Dad gives me &#39;&#39;this wordless look&#39;&#39; that translates in my manual to, &quot;I&#39;m not going to get involved, but you&#39;re handling this all wrong.&quot; I firmly order Laurel to sit down on the sofa. I make sure Janet is OK, then head over to give Laurel a talking to. She looks into my grim face and says, &quot;Mama.&quot; I gather her into my arms and say, &quot;Yes. Mama.&quot; and rock her. 

Dad says, &quot;Got out of that one.&quot; With fire in my heart, I say, &quot;Damn right. I&#39;ve been seven years to hear that and I deserve it!&quot;

Subject: Special stuff

Laurel came up to me today as I sat on the couch in the &#39;&#39;loving room*&#39;&#39;. She gently, slowly touched her finger to the back of my neck, tracing &#39;&#39;the edges of my hair&#39;&#39;. I didn&#39;t move. I didn&#39;t even breathe for fear I&#39;d break the spell. And just like the chipmunk who steals up beside you for those half-forgotten M&amp;M&#39;s you left, she ran once she&#39;d grasped her treat fully.

Do you remember in Rainman, when Charlie (Tom Cruise) tries to hug Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and Raymond screams as though in pain? And Charlie near-sobs, &quot;I just wanted to hug you. Just a little hug&quot; or words to that effect? Later, Raymond touches his forehead to Charlie&#39;s, not even looking him in the eye, and strokes him awkwardly, more like he&#39;s wiping his effect away? And almost at the end, Raymond touches his forehead to Charlie&#39;s, not even looking him in the eye, and strokes him awkwardly, more like he&#39;s wiping his hands, and it&#39;s so incredibly touching. 

Even the most tacit acknowledgment that someone else exists represents a great vulnerability for these people. It means, &quot;My world includes you. If something happens to you, my world will be broken.&quot; They are &#39;&#39;excruciatingly fragile&#39;&#39;. I keep thinking about that critique of Stone Moons, saying that you never see the affection between mother and child. It&#39;s true. Maybe the inability to express the love makes it that much more fierce. 

I have conversations with &#39;&#39;Laurel in my mind&#39;&#39;, and do things with her in my fantasies that we cannot do in &quot;real life.&quot; I bet she has similar fantasies.

Subject: Reaction to critiques of Stone Moon 

Been thinking about that critique you forwarded to me from your class you took this summer. (Ye zooks! Call out the cops, the woman actually has time to think!) Anyway, the bit about how can the mother love that child really bothered me. &quot;How will you show the love,&quot; the guy asked. I dunno. How does anyone show it?

I think my tender, intimate moments with Laurel are not &#39;&#39;dramatic*&#39;&#39;. They are the quiet minutes or hours on a Sunday morning when we have nothing to do but lie in bed, snuggling, tickling and &#39;&#39;zorfing*&#39;&#39;. Nothing &quot;important&quot; happens. The intimacy of a relationship with an autistic person is a profoundly private thing. Last night, Laurel stayed up late (until 10:30 at night.) She sat next to me on the couch as we watched The Muppet Christmas Show. Next to me. Not three inches away from the tv screen, staring slantwise. Her fingers were only two inches from me.

 Laurel got up at 6:30 the next morning (about an hour to an hour and a half early). She scooted up next to me on the bed and leaned her head on my shoulder. Nothing more. 

How will you put these practical demonstrations of love into your book? How do you define those three enigmatic words, &#39;&#39;&quot;I love you?&quot;&#39;&#39; They are defiantly simple. The intensity of emotion is in what is not displayed and in their brevity. How can you put a loving into a book when it is &#39;&#39;antipathetical to word&#39;&#39;s? Nyah, nyah. That&#39;s your problem.

Subject:  Run for your lives, she&#39;s thinking again.

Actually, on second thought, maybe love is a &#39;&#39;dramatical*&#39;&#39; kinda thing. Even the &#39;&#39;wisps of her touch&#39;&#39; behind your back, the nights you wake up and see her hanging on the bookshelf by your bed just staring at you are worthy of a trot upon the boards. You don&#39;t stage moments like that. No one whispers any prompt. There are no scripts, no words to follow.

But I whisper the words anyway. Well, I mean to whisper. But I shout them so they will pierce the ceiling and find the sky: &#39;&#39;I LOVE YOU LAUREL&#39;&#39;. I LOVE YOU &#39;&#39;JANET&#39;&#39;.

Of course, Janet shouts back. &#39;&#39;I LOVE YOU MOMMY&#39;&#39;.
 
And this is good. We run slow-mo to each other--she from the back yard and I from the porch, and hug. And giggle in the grass.

Subject:  Life&#39;s little regards

Let me tell you about another &#39;&#39;uneventful*&#39;&#39; Sunday--just to give you guys the perspective.

I suppose you don&#39;t want to hear Laurel ran out into Colorado Boulevard again. But she did it anyway, with so little regard for your kind ears...or mine, for that matter ;) . Now, now, before panicking... I&#39;ll just commence a tellin&#39; it, k?

About 7 o&#39;clock this morning, I feel a tug on my hand. Laurel had her &#39;&#39;comm book&#39;&#39; out, and put a candy bar and a swing in the &quot;This is what is going to happen now&quot; page. So she waited patiently as Janet and I got dressed and found the wallet, shoes (one tennis shoe, one high heel), dog leash, and car keys. Properly equipped, we walked to the playground. Janet and I played ring around the rosy by ourselves as there was no one else around on that frosty morning. Laurel swung happily for about 15 minutes, and even looked at me, playing peek-a-boo under her legs. I laughed. She hummed, grabbed my hand, and we were off again. 

The gas station was open and Laurel led the procession inside. She got her package of &#39;&#39;Starbursts&#39;&#39; with &quot;her&quot; money from her own fanny pack. This time, she actually pulled the money out of the pack before handing the whole thing over to the clerk. A very large incremental improvement! He laughed. I laughed again. Laurel hummed. 

Grabbed my hand and before you know it, she was struggling out into the intersection.

I ran after her, grabbed her by the middle, and pulled. She strained her entire 80 pounds against me, writhing from my grasp. I told Janet to go get help, and Janet went back into the gas station. I turned Laurel so she was on the sidewalk and I was on the street. (I just did this, I didn&#39;t think before or after, but it is nice to know maternal instincts still just kick in and adapt to modern technology.) Anyway, a cop came by (summoned by the trusty gas attendant) and saw immediately what was going on. I yelled at him to help &#39;&#39;save my daughter&#39;&#39; from going in the street. He came over and stopped traffic with one hand while pushing Laurel with the other. With one terrific heave, Laurel ran out of our grasps and into the front seat of the cop car. Buckled herself in. Gave her whole fanny pack to the officer.

He offered us a ride, and I gathered up Janet from the gas station and climbed in back.

Hey, I didn&#39;t even lose one hair on the top of my tinny tin head! We did good.

Once the moon was all powerful, &#39;&#39;all knowing&#39;&#39;. All the seas flowed into her; all the seas flowed out of her. She inhabited the lungs of every creature; she worked the bowels and hearts and tongues.

Everything lived in harmony with the moon. No one could wish for more than what the moon had given, what she had created.

The moon saw this, and it was good. She would come down to earth and the people and animals would feed her. All would rejoice mightily in the great white light as she came ever closer, ever stronger.

After the feasting, she would rise back across the horizon and take her place, lighting the stars from her own pale light. Her light grew dimmer as the stars grew brighter, and the people marvelled at the dances of the stars. And all would partake &#39;&#39;in the dance&#39;&#39;. 

This then, was primordial happiness.

So right, I&#39;m standing there in the cold wide entrance of Safeway , having wrestled Laurel out that far. She is still deftly dodging carts, defiantly overturning the newspaper stands, even kicking at the new coke machines and old penny gumball machines (now demanding 25 cents) and trying to squirm out of my arms, kick my shins, and bite me at the same time. I kept thinking of the Taz monster on tv, the whirlwind of destruction, the abu jinn of the arabian mythos. Strange where &#39;&#39;one tends to go&#39;&#39; in those split seconds.

One of the ladies at the customer service and video checkout counter looked at Laurel screaming all over the place. Gazed slowly at my bleeding arms. Solemnly offered me a tissue.

Naturally, I couldn&#39;t take it, my arms filled with hysterical child. She didn&#39;t walk out from the counter with her offering. Of course not. Rather, she carefully looked at me, looked at the tissue, and said, &quot;No dear, you probably &#39;&#39;need more than this&#39;&#39;.&quot;  

And walked off to help some other customer.

Subject: What hath man wrought?


I can&#39;t rely on the school for anything. They promise classes; they give &#39;&#39;closet space&#39;&#39;. They say they plant tomaters, but all I gets is weeds. Aack, sorry. Not doing so well on the accents today.

So I&#39;m reading Doug Biklen&#39;s and Rosemary Crossley&#39;s stuff about facilitated communication and I decide to try it mine own self. Jus&#39; little ol me and let&#39;s not bring in the system this year. 

Chris has generously offered to be my second in command whilst I teach. With the trusty aid of her Singer sewing machine, we put together a communication book for Laurel. The book is made from 2 blocks of 8 by 17 inch dark navy upholstry cloth. We cut out the pages, sewed down the middle, et voila, a book. We then bought out the local supply of velcro strips. We sewed the fuzzy edges in just like lines in a primer, and then cut up the hard plasticy edges into one inch strips. 

Then we pasted pictures on the one inch strips: Pepsi, Doritos, starbursts, Applebees, feet, arms, dresses (yellow only), shirts and socks (green only). All the things in &#39;&#39;Laurel&#39;s world&#39;&#39;. Of course magazines don&#39;t have pictures of &#39;&#39;zorfs*&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;shattered glass&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;moonbeams&#39;&#39;, but we made do. 

Now we have a place in the book for what is coming up, what has happened, what is happening. So the book (and the plastic bag of velcro&#39;d concepts) go with us. We actually got Laurel to take it and velcro for an aggregate total of 15 minutes out of 5 hours trying the first day.

Not so bad, eh? When you consider that home schoolers just need to be in educational status for 4 hours a day (the educators themselves figure the rest is lost in &#39;&#39;administrivia*&#39;&#39;.) When you subtract out class distractions and get to the individual attention, you probably have about what we got.

Subject: And now, for something completely different

You will never in a million billion trillion quadrillion years guess what happened. So I will tell you. Before I burst out in tears of rapture. In smiles, using muscles my face didn&#39;t know I had. YES!!! Today is more than a red letter day, it is a rainbow, a &#39;&#39;laurel*&#39;&#39; wreath, an oscartonygrammypulitzernobel day. 

Chris and I had been working with Laurel and her comm book all morning. Just when we were going to quit for lunch, Laurel put a Pepsi icon in the &quot;&#39;&#39;This is what is going to happen&#39;&#39;&quot; page and got (drumroll here.....) a Pepsi! Dah did did dah! yes!! all right!! She took the Pepsi, opened the top, slugged it back like a pro, slammed it on the table in an end zone hike right on the Pepsi icon.

While Chris and I were high-fiving, Laurel went off and put in the Muppets Go to New York video. She put her hands on her ears and hummed while we ostentatiously moved the Pepsi icon from the &quot;This is what is going to happen&quot; page to the &quot;&#39;&#39;This is what happened page.&#39;&#39;&quot; She didn&#39;t look at us, not even out of the corners of her eyes.

None the less, never the more, it didn&#39;t really matter.  We made contact. Repeat, Houston, we have contact! Liftoff!!

 Chris went home to her long neglected family. Laurel rocked back and forth in front of the tv, mesmerized by Kermit. I snuggled with Janet for a while, and we giggled over Candyland.

After the muppets finished making havoc of New York City, I put a bath/shower icon on the &quot;this is what is going to happen page&quot; and all three of us piled into the shower. I left the spilled water and soap on the floor as our icons of triumph.

I don&#39;t want to imply a connection where one may not be, but we started Laurel back on Evening Primrose Oil last night (I&#39;d run out, but I got some more) and today was much, much better. I have also &#39;&#39;bombarded her&#39;&#39; with Vitamin B, and am doing a regimen of &#39;&#39;zorfs*&#39;&#39;.

We are working with Laurel, getting her to find a banana and put it on the word &quot;banana,&quot; find an orange and put it on the word &quot;orange&quot; (She does amazingly well at this, actually. When she does put an object on the word it is right. The only difficulty comes when she puts the object on the couch or the table, and cannot understand that this does not count in the strange game we play.) Laurel began to walk away and try the front doors. Rob just put another complicated switch on it so she can&#39;t get out without an alarm going off and she has yet to figure the new one out. Chris gave her the communication/icon book that we&#39;ve been developing. Laurel took out the &quot;Safeway&quot; (grocery store) icon and put it on the velcro strip on the first page the area that says &quot;this is what is now going to happen.&quot; 

Bless Chris, she agreed to stay and greet Janet when she came home from day camp at 3 (it was about 2:30) while I jumped in the car to take Laurel to Safeway. Wandering up and down each aisle and examining the floorboards very carefully, she was extremely quiet. She chose Doritos and Pepsi and candy, located in widely different areas in the store. Then she strode purposefully up to a lighted counter. There were a few people ahead of her and she waited in line, holding the Pepsi bottle like a baby and crooning to it. When the clerk got to us, she gave the bottle to him to see it, and then snatched it back. Then she rooted through my purse, got my wallet, handed it to the clerk. The clerk handed me back my wallet; I gave Laurel cash to give to the clerk (reinforcement behaviour). But Laurel tried to find a slot in the checkstand machinery to put it in.  You can kind of understand her dilemma surely there can&#39;t be more than one way to pay at the grocery store.  Everything has to go through the slot and back into her purse. Except that the clerk wants to keep the money. We finally got it clear. 

What a cutie! We got home and things were fine. 

Thus today, I was on a cloud. Nah, on a roller coaster of clouds. Screaming up into the soft floating air, flying like nothing was holding me on the ground, dreaming of true weightlessness. 

I waxed ecstatic to Mrs. Cooper four doors down when she came out to sweep the walk. I rhapsodized over Laurel&#39;s appropriate use of her comm book. Not to mention her appropriate use of my arms, legs, etc. I kissed my &#39;&#39;healing bruises&#39;&#39; I was so happy.

Mrs. Cooper cracked a smile and shook my hand.

Life has been really great this week--which is why I haven&#39;t written.  (This is sort of like the way the Japanese treat fortunes at their temples--if you get a good one, you leave it at the temple so the gods remember, and if you get a bad one, you leave it at the temple so the gods forget. ) So forgive me for not writing when there is good stuff happening--and when there is bad stuff.

But right now, there is only good.  Laurel can communicate. She knows what she wants. I can see the person inside, like the first tips of pale yellow color swelling from a tight furry green rosebud.

This evening, Laurel decided to take a walk. She dumped all of the icons out for her comm book and frenetically searched through them. Finally selecting the slide, Pepsi, book, tree, and starburst icons, she slathered the whole mess on the this is what is about to happen page in her comm book. Then she gathered up the book and walked out the door with it, cradling it in her arms. She didn&#39;t let me see the book of course, but as I was hovering just in front of her, I could see what was going on.

I darted back into the house a half dozen times, getting money, Kodi&#39;s collar and leash, my shoes! And Laurel waited out front, &#39;&#39;amidst but not with&#39;&#39; a bunch of neighborhood kids. We walked up to the school and she tried to get in. Alas, it was locked up tight. She pointed to the book icon on her comm book and then the school. Yes! &#39;&#39;COMMUNICATION&#39;&#39;!!!! NO! I don&#39;t have the KEY!!!

Communication does not quite yet grasp Sundays in summer. Luckily, on one of my half dozen trips back to the house, I&#39;d picked up Jane Eyre, and Laurel was content to take the book over to the merry go round in the playground. She lay face up, holding the book like a fashionable fan and flipping the pages--upside down.

So we played on the playground. Every time I glanced at Laurel, &#39;&#39;Janet urgently needed&#39;&#39; me to watch her. Janet did cartwheels, loop-the-loops, and &#39;&#39;summersalts*&#39;&#39;. So Laurel pretty much wandered about and did whatever without supervision. When the sun was kissing the mountains, we made our calm egress through the dust-pink light. 

Anyway, I just had to tell you guys. I am still so thrilled! I want to just grab this feeling and part it and lock it up in the refrigerator like the friends sourdough starter. And &#39;&#39;have it forever&#39;&#39;.

 I cannot keep my hands on the keyboard! Good night. Really, really good night.

Subject: Another quiet day

Celebrate with me! As someone said, &quot;the best is yet to be!&quot; 

The comm book is still working. Laurel actually gave me the book with the icon for starbursts (a little starburst wrapper) and store on the &quot;This is what is going to happen now&quot; page.  Then she handed me my shoes, coat, wallet, and dog leash.  These, she has evidently decided, are the primary requisites for any venture on the outside. This is one &#39;&#39;ritual&#39;&#39; I can definitely live with! I got the car keys, but Laurel took them out of my hand. 

So we walked. Laurel chose to head for the Safeway about four blocks away. She even passed up the little &#39;&#39;gas station&#39;&#39; that she likes better. She selected a six pack each of Pepsi and Coke, decided against Doritos and chose a box of Fruit Loops. Shock City! If I&#39;ve ever bought them, it&#39;s been years. We don&#39;t shop the cereal aisle at Safeway; Chris gets the bulk cereal at Wild Oats and brings it by for us. So this really was some heavy flexibility.

Choosing the least crowded aisle (the one with no cashier), Laurel lay down her basket and headed for the candy machines, leaving me to pay for it all. Surprise! I made sure Laurel brought her fanny-pack, and I gave her her allowance before we left the house. I waited, and coached her to take the basket over to the cashier. She wasn&#39;t sure exactly what was expected, but after some prompting, she handed over her wallet. (Oh well, close enough.) She had $5 and change and the tab came to $8 and change. Her attention was waning quickly as she moved toward the beckoning colored gums, so I asked the cashier to take off the Pepsi. She did, gave Laurel the change and receipt (and wallet), and her bag. Laurel waited by the gumball machines, her fingers tracing the long slide inside the clear tube. I led her away. She lunged back inside (for the Pepsi? for something else we&#39;d neglected?). I grabbed her and told her she didn&#39;t have enough money. She did not appear convinced, but conceded to the inevitability of my irrationality. 

Several times, she asked me to carry the bag. I declined. She carried it all the way home after that, even offering it to me and snatching it away, offering and snatching. Janet held my hand and we swung up and down, up and down, in tune with Laurel&#39;s antics. At home, Laurel put her things away by herself, and sat down to enjoy &quot;The Muppet Movie.&quot; She hummed the rainbow song over and over through the whole thing even before the movie began! I took it as a good sign and hummed right along with her.

Ignoring, for the moment, that we were pretty much entirely on Laurel&#39;s agenda, and I made almost no demands on her aside from those directly leading to her getting what she wanted, this was a pretty terrific evening. Y&#39;know, no blood and stuff.

Subject:  My Class Essay

Dear Mrs. Stegall,
Here is my essay. 


Having an Autistic Sister


Sometimes I do stuff that Laurel my sister does not like. Then she gets upset. These are things I don&#39;t know about sometimes like going through the door first when we get home from something. I don&#39;t even know she&#39;s going to get mad, but she starts chasing me and trying to hit me. She starts crying and yelling. She seems really frustrated. Sometimes she claws me.

One of the worst things about having an autistic sister is that sometimes, when they&#39;re really mad, &#39;&#39;they&#39;ll start going nuts&#39;&#39; and clawing and pinching and pulling hair and hitting. And kicking. When she claws me, the way it feels to my mind is like kissing a cat and a dog at the same time ~ while they&#39;re both growling. It&#39;s yucky and scary. You think the animals are going to get in a fight. So you&#39;re scared. When she claws me, I usually try to break away. I either run or I hit her because I am afraid. Later I say I am sorry I hit you. Laurel doesn&#39;t say anything cuz &#39;&#39;she can&#39;t talk*&#39;&#39;. 

It&#39;s humiliating when Laurel gets mad in public. Sometimes at the store, it&#39;s especially humiliating cuz we know a lot of the people there. There have been times when I felt very proud of myself because, when Mom had to deal with my sister at the grocery store, I got to take over the paying and getting the stuff on the list. &#39;&#39;I felt so old and responsible&#39;&#39; - not like forty years old, but like a big kid. (Even if I was already seven. Seven is big, too. ) 

A lot of the time, I feel sorry for her because she can&#39;t talk; she can&#39;t get her message across and so she gets frustrated cuz people don&#39;t know what she wants.

Sometimes kids say, &quot;At least I&#39;m better than your retarded sister!&quot; 

I try to say, &quot;She&#39;s not retarded!&quot;

But they say, &quot;She can&#39;t talk and she&#39;s dumb. That&#39;s retarded.&quot;

There&#39;s one thing they don&#39;t know that she does. When they say that, they&#39;re actually saying she can&#39;t talk, twice, cuz dumb means &quot;can&#39;t talk&quot;.  Sometimes I&#39;m sorrier for them than for Laurel, cuz they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying!

Laurel isn&#39;t mean. She&#39;s very sweet . She blows bubbles at me in the bathtub and we laugh. 

Whenever I really need &#39;&#39;attention*&#39;&#39;, my mom is there. It&#39;s just that Laurel needs it more often than I do. I pretty much accept that, but sometimes it&#39;s very difficult.

One of the best things about having an autistic sisterÑ it&#39;s also a bad thing, tooÑis when you have friends over, they have an excellent time with her, and that feels good because you want your friends to have a good time, but it&#39;s bad because you invited your friends over to be with you and it feels a little bit like they&#39;re ignoring you.

The other day, my best friend &#39;&#39;Carina&#39;&#39; came over and she and Laurel were running around, playing chase, and they were having a great time. I ended up playing video games for about half the visit cuz Carina was too busy playing with Laurel.

Sometimes, when I&#39;m on the phone, Laurel starts playing with an extension and pressing the buttons. It&#39;s really annoying, cuz my friends think it&#39;s me, and hang up. I haven&#39;t lost a friend over it yet. Sometimes I have to call my friends back, and I pick up, but he&#39;s playing with it, and I think someone&#39;susing the phone, and my friends get mad again.

Sometimes, when we&#39;re at the pool, &#39;&#39;Laurel really scares me&#39;&#39; by pushing Mom underwater, then not letting her up. I&#39;m afraid she&#39;ll drown. Once she even dunked me! I was so afraid, I almost hit her!

Subject: The cost of raising a child is over $100,000

Is THAT all? You would think it was higher. Sort of like the IRS tax forms:

          Line A. How much money did you make last year? _________

          Line B: Write a check for Line A and send it in.

Anyway, this morning, &#39;&#39;Janet&#39;&#39; and I discussed all the work that needs to be done to keep the household working smoothly. (More of a forced discussion, actually. If I could have tied her to the chair wihout &#39;&#39;getting it from the SS&#39;&#39;, I would have.) I&#39;ve informed her that these are not things she gets paid for; she gets money for the things she needs. She cleans her room and looks after her things because she is a person. She helps with the laundry and the dishes because she&#39;s a member of this family. She will do what she needs to do to be a member of her school and community. Ahh the lectures in this household.

 We sat down and figured out what her expenses are: if she were to put one third of her income into savings and donate ten percent to a worthy, charitable organization, and pay for her own goodies and outings, and presents for friends and family, and half of any special classes she wants to take, like karate or dance or drama, and her miscellaneous needs such as hair accessories, bike locks and what not  that works out to about $20 per week! 

I&#39;ve told her also that I will buy her clothes, but if she paints or cuts or otherwise ruins them, she must pay to replace them. Also, I&#39;ll pay for toothbrushes and toothpaste and routine dental attention, but _ she _ pays for cavities. 

She asked me, &quot;Does this mean Laurel pays for stuff?&quot; 

I said, well, &quot;Laurel isn&#39;t ready to understand the real world yet, so we have to be a bit patient.&quot;

Janet said, &quot;I like Laurel&#39;s world better.&quot;

Ya know, I almost had to agree! 

Laurel is treating the comm book like a normal part of everyday life. She got it out and we went to the store again. I tried to go past the convenience store, but Laurel wanted to go in. She selected a Pepsi, some Doritos, and some LifeSavers gummies, and almost walked out the door with them. I signaled to the clerk, who quickly got out of his bulletproof case and stood at the door. (Thank whatever deity is currently in vogue that the store was empty and he could do that!) So Laurel stopped, staring at brightly colored package in her hand and the imposing denim blocking the door. She turned around and handed the clerk her wallet.

This, I must say is vocational progress. But she spent a total of $5.06 there today. Another hefty allowance, and she is not doing her own saving, presents, classes, etc. Oh me...I&#39;m not sure I can &#39;&#39;afford Laurel&#39;s world&#39;&#39;.

G&#39;night. I&#39;m going to bed. G&#39;night.

Subject: Independance Day Muse

Happy fourth to all, and to all a good night! Any how is it, life has certainly calmed down in the last month or so. Dad took care of Laurel while I went to work for a couple of hours (a stop-gap, &#39;&#39;temporary driving&#39;&#39; job for a friend...)

 The comm book is working. We add about four new words a day--Laurel peruses the paper&#39;s ads like a pro. We have a watch picture that she sets to match the hall clock (and I thank god every day it is the old fashioned hands and seconds, the numbers would be just too fast to change). The sun gods have smiled down upon us--we have gone for walks on the Highline Canal every day for the past week and have crossed Colorado Boulevard without a single incident. Janet has a new toy--someone showed her how to use an old vaccuum tube to suck crayfish out of the creek without getting any of the water on her or in her. So she sucks them out, touches the claws, says ooooh, tries to get Laurel interested, and then carefully puts them right back in the water.

Laurel has gone to Safeway every day this week to buy Pepsi and Doritos. She does not eat them - or rather, she tears open the plastic, places three &#39;&#39;Doritos&#39;&#39; in her mouth, hums &quot;Peanut, peanut butter&quot; with more enthusiasm than the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and chomps down hard. Then she leaves the package on top of the refrigerator.

And who is to thank for this wondrous interlude? Dr. Morgan credits the &#39;&#39;Risperdal*&#39;&#39; he prescribed to replace the Clonidine, Ms. Bradshaw thinks it is the good weather, Mrs. Macdougal thinks Social Services has finally gotten to my case, and me, I&#39;m afraid the fragile structure of this peace would collapse under scrutiny. I point blank refuse to analyze. Under no threat of anything.

Laurel is going through a bed smoothing phase right now. She takes the sheet and smooths it over her bed, gently rubbing out every single wrinkle. When she gets finished, she &#39;&#39;does it again&#39;&#39;. She is occupied in this for hours at a stretch. 

I even bought bath salts the last time we were out. And used them. Morning Mist. And had time to notice something. I am not even bruised anywhere right now. For the first time in ages of months. (Ages of monks? How old are monks, anyway?)

Even better - Laurel is not cowering over the cherry bombs and stink crackers resounding in the street. She is simply avoiding the windows. Hoorah, an action to control her environment, as the &#39;&#39;shrinkspeak&#39;&#39; says.

Subject: A chicken in every pot, and a boy for every girl...

Hello friends: )
 
Prepare for yet another installment in the actual (and thus placidly boring tah dah! lives of the silver girls (I could have chosen golden, or platinum, but those were already taken..) This ongoing series is brought to you live via the Internet (What did we ever do without&#39;&#39; e-mail&#39;&#39;? I can no longer remember...larger phone bills, probably...)

Around three today, Laurel decided she wanted to go for a walk, but Janet went into the garage barefoot and got a glass sliver in her foot. After a soak in the tub, Janet allowed me to douse it with Orajel and work it out with a needle and cuticle scissors. (Where do all the tweezers go?) She hummed and bit her thumb while I worked and barely felt a thing. Janet hopped on her bike, and we allowed Laurel to lead us out. 

It is noteworthy that Laurel chose not to go out until we were ready. She stood at the door with her comm book and pounded the &quot;This is what is going to happen&quot; page against the doorknob, but she didn&#39;t actually touch the doorknob until she saw us.  When she did, she started off down the street, looking back over her shoulder and coming back when she saw we weren&#39;t following. Janet rode her bike, and we brought Kodi on a leash. Laurel walked up Kearney to Yale, then east and into the gas station on Colorado Boulevard when she saw &#39;&#39;we weren&#39;t following&#39;&#39;. 

Laurel led us across Colorado Boulevard to the park. As we were going across the busy driveways at the shopping center, she linked arms with me or placed her hand on my elbow. She pushed the button for the walk light at the intersection. 

Yelling wildly, Laurel made for the slide. She pushed three different kids down the slide. Not violently, just sort of helping. One didn&#39;t complain, and the other two complained so constantly about everything that their parents kind of dismissed them. She played a bit, accepted that Kodi did not want to go down the slide...after only fifteen minutes of pushing that poor patient dog up the slide ladder. Then she went off to her large elm in the northwest corner of the playground and spread sand into the knothole, watching it spill down to the ground. When the sun left the tree, Laurel indicated that we would leave by heading back a bit and then waiting for Janet and me to scramble after her. 

While we were at the playground, Janet met a younger man, a kindergartner, though he was her height. He quickly rushed his hands through his dark cowlick and offered the resulting grime to Janet. They held hands and promenaded around the merry-go-round and finally settled on the seesaw. They exchanged crabapple blossoms before he left, and he drew a heart in the sand. Janet &#39;&#39;raved&#39;&#39; about his dark blue eyes, thick lashes, and gorgeous nose and informed me he would be back next Saturday. Oh my... 

Laurel asked for a shower, and actually let me trim her hair for about ten minutes before she took the scissors from me, wrapped them in a wet washcloth, and put them carefully back on the bathroom cabinet shelf at right angles to the cuticle scissors. Her hair is a bit longer on the front/right quadrant, but there&#39;s always tomorrow. What interested me is that Laurel was quite resistant until I started talking about how Jack &#39;&#39;Cooper&#39;&#39; (also a younger man a first grader down the street) thought she was cute. Then she calmed right down. Oh my....

Subject: All the groceries of our lives

Getting back to the keyboard to finish up my story. Things are calm now. Laurel is spinning plates in the kitchen, just where I can see her. She looks up at the ceiling and grins about ever three minutes, and her shoulders shrug back into a laugh. Reliving the moment, no doubt.

Janet went to bed after the ninty-nth showing of Beauty and the Beast. She wants to be just like Beauty when she grows up, and she keeps putting her hair in that thick-sided ponytail. Her primary goal in life? Not to read and get ahead. Oh no. To sprinkle bird seed and have birds come down on her head. She is all for practicing right now, but I told her Mrs. Pots had already put Chips to bed. And she believed me. For once. 

Right, back to the tale at hand. I have &#39;&#39;mixed feelings&#39;&#39; about confessing that, upon our arrival at home, I took Laurel into her room and spanked her. Laurel locked her door herself and stayed in self-imposed exile for about 6 hours.

I put away groceries. I called the Dr Morgan, our latest pediatric neurologist, who has had extensive experience with autistic kids. Or at least as much as anyone. And at least he understands that each kid is different. Got the Ellie, the new nurse practitioner. She suggests giving Laurel a higher dose of the&#39;&#39; Clonidine*&#39;&#39; prescribed (at an already ridiculously high dose) last spring. We agree that Laurel is in distress and needs help. They have an opening for an emergency appointment next week, and will call if something &#39;&#39;comes up sooner*&#39;&#39;.  

Laurel went to sleep on the kitchen floor, and I just put her soft blanket near her so she can cover up if she wants to. She is sleeping the slep of the dead, the truly exhausted. As I will be in a few minutes. First, I want to wash off my arms and take a long bath the first I have had time for in a long time. I have about 3 dozen bleeding scratches and bruises that won&#39;t show fully for days. My arms looked like violent rejects from an octopus-lover.

Subject: Take two. Cut. Retake.

I want to write happy and sweet cause it&#39;s just nearly dawn, and the birdies are hardyring away wondering where they are going to go this fall, and some idiot ghost of a past voice is singing morning has broken. I think it was my voice. I dunno. 

I haven&#39;t had any sleep--Laurel is still up and I haven&#39;t dared sleep while she is raging. The door alarms have gone off twice in the last three hours. So far, I&#39;ve managed to beat her to it. Typing seems to calm her, although I am not sure about the hum of the computer. So I&#39;ll sit and &#39;splore with you guys. If you&#39;ve heard it all before, don&#39;t bother with the rest of this.

The background goes something like this. Laurel is definitely an aborigine from the &#39;&#39;moon&#39;&#39;. We all know this, but I give just a couple more recent examples to illustrate my point. The child is one frustrated walkabout. But if I could just figure out why (or even have a half-second warning ahead of time) we wouldn&#39;t be so damned stymied. Let me explain. It&#39;s the only fun I&#39;m gonna get today.

Sunday, Laurel walked up to the &#39;&#39;gas station&#39;&#39; and I followed (what choice did I have?) I had no way of knowing where she was going, and I had not had time to grab my purse. Also, Kodi-dog was with us, without a leash. I managed to tackle her and sit on her while holding the dog, but I only managed this at the last possible minute so we were at an awkward place, laying in the doorway, tasting the greasy metal, and blocking all paying customers. Couldn&#39;t even call for help, let alone get Laurel anything she wanted. I sent a pleading look at the clerk, asked him to call my buddy Chris. The clerk cheerfully phoned from inside his bullet-proof case. My buddy Chris sent her husband in his spiffy new Jeep, who picked up Laurel and dragged her screaming into the Jeep. To calm her a bit, we shouted the first line of Peanut, peanut butter, which anyone who knows me knows really well.
 
An hour or two later, she walked out again. This time I grabbed my purse before following her. It had been raining, so I sent Janet back to get her raincoat and catch up to us on her bike. She let Kodi out in the process. 

Laurel took a short cut, ducking through a gap in a fence too small for the bike. I told Janet to lock it up and join us on foot, but she lost us in the delay. So there I was with Laurel wandering around in a cold muddy field and my unleashed dog, and my seven year old daughter missing. I tried to get Laurel to go back, and she simply wouldn&#39;t. She sat on the muddy ground (it had rained hard, with some occasional sleet) in those intervening two hours between trips) and kicked at me. I finally put her in a half-Nelson (as I understand it -- I was never an athlete) and lifted her essentially by her head. She would move forward a few feet before struggling away. We progressed about thirty feet that way before she figured out how to keep my near frozen fingers from getting a purchase on her mud-slippery limbs. Then I grabbed her by the hair and led her, which worked for another twenty feet before she began grabbing me by the hair, ripping off and flinging my glasses. Fortunately, Janet arrived in the car of our cross-the-street neighbor, whose name I still don&#39;t know. 

When she couldn&#39;t find us, she had returned home and summoned adult help, directing our neighbor to where she last saw us. By an exhaustive process of pushing, pulling, lifting by the jaw and dragging, I got Laurel into the back seat. It took many minutes. During the whole ride home, she kept snatching at me, ripping out handfuls of my hair. I can deal with the pain, but I really hate that sound. 

&#39;&#39;Janet told me&#39;&#39; she thought it was all her fault, for letting Kodi out. I told her no way. Laurel goes off sometimes and it isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault. I did ask her to think next time there was a crisis, though, and try to keep Kodi from following as that is just one more distraction. Whew. Talk about mixed messages!

Who was it who noted the aggression happens when Laurel ventures anywhere away from a narrowly defined comfort zone (her small classroom, her backyard, her room, her kitchen)? &quot;Tis true. I truly feel that Laurel rages in her walls of frustration at her inability to communicate, and her perception that her needs are being unreasonably denied. C&#39;est trop vrai that she doesn&#39;t often get her way, mostly because I don&#39;t know what her way is, but often for other reasons--like I haven&#39;t brought my purse, or I need to look after Janet, or the dog is with us or some such. I don&#39;t think Laurel is aware enough of money or of other&#39;s needs and various rules to know more than just &quot;Mom&#39;s being mean.&quot; When we are home, Laurel can get almost anything she wants. When she needs help with something, she can say &quot;Guh&quot; to ask me to come with her, and show me what is wrong. 

Fights are nearly always about wanting to go somewhere, and I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m gonna quit typing now and put some calamine lotion on my cuts (No peroxide left, I gotta get stock in a medical company, or at least stock up more) and then wash the mud out of what&#39;s left of my hair, see if Laurel is calm enough to go to class so I can get to the preschool and teach. Wonder if they&#39;ll ask about the pink stuff?

Subject: Once more into the breach, my friends 

This is being typed right in the wake of the storm, so by the time you read it and get all distressed, I&#39;ll probably be fine.

We went shopping. I got Laurel everything she wanted until we came to the candy aisle. She wanted Reese&#39;s &#39;&#39;peanut butter&#39;&#39; cups. She&#39;s violently allergic to peanut butter, but no matter, obviously the thick sweet stuff has nothing to do with the belly-rendering and scream erupting tornadoes later.

 I offered her Rolos, I offered her Snickers, I pointed out Mars bars and &#39;&#39;Starbursts&#39;&#39; and Milky Ways, but I signed our &quot;no&quot; to the Reeses. So she began attacking me. Ham-fisting me in the face over and over. Pulling my hair. Kicking me. She scratched my face up and I was bleeding. She had my blood smeared on her face. (I was afraid I had been so angry I&#39;d hit her without realizing it, in kind of a mini-berserker rage. But it was ok--it was only my blood.) So I told Janet to ask for some tissues and a wet clean up and gave her the credit card to pay for what we had. I hoped wildly it wasn&#39;t the maxed out one. You think of the oddest things in the arms of the storm.

My plan was to get Laurel out of the store as soon as possible. But Laurel decided she wanted chips and Pepsi, so we were going through the checkout line, period. She still kept roaring and attacking me every minute or so in the check-out line. You&#39;d think the people would have offered to let me go on ahead, but they were kind of busy not staring, I think. 

Janet handed me back the credit card. Laurel intercepted and threw it at the clerk, barely missing his eye. The clerk calmly took it, noted the numbers, handed Laurel the chips and Pepsi, and I scrawled something out on the piece of paper. You would think this was an everyday occurrence for this guy. Which, I dunno, it might be. I guided Laurel out, all the while she was screaming and throwing herself on the ground and hitting with the Pepsi cans and grabbing my hair or hitting my face.

A man came up behind us and said, &quot;&#39;&#39;Your mother loves you.&#39;&#39;&quot; I have not idea what he looks like or who he was. I couldn&#39;t drop my shields for long enough to look at him. I couldn&#39;t even wonder at the time why he didn&#39;t just get us a damp rag or a pair of cuffs or a circus elephant or something useful like that.

We got home and Laurel jumped out of the car and went for me again. I knocked her on the ground, grabbed her hair, pulled her head back and smacked her. I know. Now you all know what an ogre I am. I put her in her room. Then I went and got a cup of cold water, and then unlocked her door. She threatened to come after me, but every time, I&#39;d hold the cup up, and she&#39;d back away. She spends hours a day in the shower, but she does not like getting splashed.

God, am I feeling melodramatic and sorry for myself. I want to say I&#39;m sorry for alarming everybody, but I&#39;m not capable of being sorry for anyone but me right now. Nobody&#39;s terminally ill. We have a place to stay and food in the cupboard. And, of course, I have all of you, but it&#39;s not the same as a real flesh-and-blood shoulder to cry on, or better yet, &#39;&#39;babysitter&#39;&#39;, is it?

Subject: Venting. 


Yesterday, Laurel went walkabout and I followed. I physically kept her from walking out into Colorado Boulevard for about 15 minutes, until Mr. &#39;&#39;Cooper&#39;&#39; drove by, recognized the situation, and pulled over. He and I grabbed Laurel by both arms and one foot and shoved her into the car. Then we dragged her into the house, where she pulled my hair, punched and kicked me. I pushed her into her room and locked her in. I owe that couple. Massive major. And I don&#39;t even know their first names. 

But still I am pawing the ground. Snort snort snort, heavy breath, heavy breath, heavy breath (and not all of it from the &#39;&#39;bone-murdering trauma&#39;&#39; of keeping Laurel from running into a highway at the thick of rush hour). Mostly, I&#39;m mad about the people who honked and swore at me like I was killing my child--and yet offered not their one little pinky to help me save her.

Rationally, I suppose what they all saw out the window was a mean mother grabbing any convenient part of an unruly child&#39;s anatomy for some ill-tempered venting. They didn&#39;t see the age-old drama of mother putting herself in physical danger to save the life of the child. These are the same folks who would applaud a mother bear mauling a host of enemies to save her cub, or a woman shooting an intruder to save her child.

But they don&#39;t extend that to someone restraining a wild child from hurtling into a highway. Oh, no, if things get that bad, they may reason to themselves (if they reason at all behind the smug little wheels of their Mercedes) then just throw the child away. Don&#39;t save it, put it into an &#39;&#39;institution&#39;&#39; and forget about it.

After all, once it&#39;s there, it won&#39;t come back to ask why.

I&#39;m gonna give this to Ms. Bradshaw, district coordinator of Special Education. Then I&#39;m gonna give it to the State Department of Education. Then I&#39;m gonna publish it in a paperÑif they&#39;ll take it.
Your comments, please? 

To CCSD 4/96 from Sarah Murphy 
Subject:   Laurel Murphy 

I wish it noted for the record that I feel Laurel&#39;s educational program has been driven solely by what resources the district can readily findÑnot what is appropriate or what could be done with a little effort.

There has been no attempt to address Laurel&#39;s current level of functioning. She has not been observed by any qualified school staff since 10/16/96. The most appropriate environment has not been questioned. The only question has been, &quot;Who will take her and not do significant damage?&quot; 

I have contacted everyone I could think of and followed every lead, trying to &#39;&#39;locate resources*&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve found nothing&#39;&#39;. 

I believe that Ms. Bradshaw has made more than the minimum reasonable efforts to identify resources, with the same results. With the prevalence of autistic-constellation disorders dramatically on the rise, this concerns me. I also find it disparaging as to the likelihood of finding appropriate services for Laurel in the future. Either we (and all those we have contacted) have failed to identify the needed resources, or they simply do not exist. The latter possibility should be of great concern to the district. 

I agree that the minimum immediate requirements are:  

1. A school atmosphere with individually designed curriculum, well-trained and supported personnel. 
2. Attention to developing communication, social, physical and academic skills. 
3. Behavior management programming with least possible use of restraints and aversives, and maximum focus on teaching functional communication, with appropriate reinforcements. 
4. Behavior charting by qualified staff, with the goal of recommending less restrictive placement, as appropriate. 
5. Transportation to and from educational setting. 
6. Opportunity to participate in increasingly integrated settings. 
7. As much consistency in staff and routine as possible.

Other necessary supports, to be determined may include but are not limited to computer hardware and software, other curriculum materials, other alternative communication devices, and consultation with specialists. 

Laurel must participate in a loosely structured, integrated environment in her own neighborhood. This will continue the &#39;&#39;critical association with her neighborhood peers&#39;&#39;, and provide the peer role-modeling that Laurel needs and deserves. 

The school may set definite objective criteria for the progression of this component. I would suggest that she be accompanied by a trained one-on-one, and that her readiness to participate be recommended by two observers acceptable to the district, who should also be involved in the training of the integration assistant. Participation should be for no less than four hours each week, in two or more sessions per week. 

I submit the &#39;&#39;following facts&#39;&#39; for consideration:   

1) In Fall of 1993, as a condition of my agreement to have Laurel removed from the neighborhood school (Cattail Elementary) to a center-based program, I specified that Laurel must have some semi-structured interaction with the neighborhood children. Ms. Bradshaw said there would be &quot;no problem with that.&quot; There was no follow-up. Laurel was in a room by herself and in fact she did not see other children her own age at any time.

2) In Fall of 1994, the district recommended that Laurel remain in the integrated setting while working on behavioral issues. The school rejected this recommendation. I conceded the need for intense behavioral intervention and allowed the restricted &quot;diagnostic placement&quot; with the proviso that an aggressive plan for rapid re-integration be developed placement&quot; with the proviso that an aggressive plan for rapid re-integration be developed and implemented. This was included in the IEP. No plan was implemented. Laurel again had no contact whatsoever with her peers. This two years without peer contact seriously undermined efforts to improve social skills. 

3) In Fall of 1995, Carrie Abbott and Marilyn Lincoln had identified and documented the behaviors that made integration impractical. Programatic facilitation was available, and medical (pharmaceutical) intervention was deemed necessary by all parties, to alleviate the remaining obstacles to Laurel&#39;s ability to be successfully integrated. Pharmaceutical intervention was initiated in Feb. 1996. Both Carrie and Marilyn have since documented improvement and have been discussing plans to integrate Laurel into some classroom activities.

I submit that the unfortunate change in availability of staff does not reflect on Laurel&#39;s ability, need for, or right to integration. 

4) Marilyn Abbot has documented that Laurel &#39;s primary mode of learning is imitation. Pro-active planning is critical. We must begin immediately to identify placements for the summer, next school year, and beyond (and, if applicable, additional instruction days to compensate for the lack of programming in the traditional year). The plans must necessarily be more fluid, the further they are in the future; however, these past months have provided ample evidence that availability of suitable programming and qualified staff are not obtained readily or quickly. Moreover, such attention to the long- term will help us focus on Laurel &#39;s progressive goals.

I require that Laurel&#39;s summer program address the following:   
1) Peer integration. 
2) Maintenance and improvement (because of lack of traditional year programming and to help prepare for integration) of academic skills. 
3) Recreational skills (I suggest an informal survey of the recreational habits of typical 3rd and 4th grade girls:   to truly integrate with peers, should Laurel be able to ride a bike? play Nintendo? play Barbies, jacks, football? What do 9 year old girls do?) 

To ensure Laurel&#39;s future, I would like to evaluate the suitability of BD and/or Speech Disorder programs, with an emphasis on skills acquisition rather than correction (reactive programming.) All of the research I&#39;ve encountered indicates that behavioral problems are largely reduced in such an environment, and that more inclusive settings are more likely to be so oriented. I realize that this is mostly &quot;resource driven&quot;, however recent experience leads me to believe that this will be more practical than relying on availability of individuals qualified to create an appropriate program especially for Laurel . 

Because of the district&#39;s failure to identify and provide an appropriate education for my daughter, I was forced to give up my job. Not only is this damaging to my emotional well-being, my social network and my employment record (making it more difficult to obtain future employment), it is also financially devastating.  Moreover, it was legally and ethically unconscionable. In addition to loss of wages, I no longer had any time to do errands, and was forced to pay a respite provider whenever I needed to do those things I normally did when Laurel was in school (e.g., groceries, doctor appointments). 

This also made it necessary for me to &#39;&#39;transport Laurel&#39;&#39; without another adult in the car, which posed serious hazards because of Laurel &#39;s behaviors, and actually resulted in injury to Laurel and myself on several occasions. In partial recompense, the district will either:   

A. Compensate me for lost wages, at the rate I was formerly earning: $8.75 per hour for 20 hours per week for each week that the district denied services to Laurel.  (I won&#39;t claim compensation for the hours I missed when I was called to pick up Laurel early, or the four days during which she was suspended; only a due process hearing would resolve whether it was a permissible suspension, and I&#39;m saving my fighting instincts for more important things) through the date she is returned to an acceptable program. 

Please note that I do not ask the district to compensate for the time it takes me to find a new job, or for the fact that the need for additional research and development of programs covering the period after the end of the traditional school year severely compromises my ability to seek employment even after Laurel is in programming. In short, I am being almost contemptibly generous even after Laurel is in programming. In short, I am being almost contemptibly generous in this request. 

B. The district will hire me, retroactive to the date of nonservice and continuing until such time as Laurel is placed in an appropriate program, at the rate of $8.75 per hour for six hours per day, for every instructional day on the traditional CCSD calendar. 

I submit that the district had already recognized the need for two-on-one staffing for Laurel. Also, that I was called upon to develop and implement a program beyond my qualifications, and certainly beyond what would be reasonable to require of any parent. This partially redresses the damage to my future job qualifications, as it provides an employment history. I might be willing to forgive certain legal violations on the part of CCSD if this arrangement were honored. 

In any event, I believe that this is the just thing to do. I have researched legal precedent in three states, though I have found no precedent in Colorado. It would be nice if a qualified person from CCSD could evaluate the program I have established for Laurel and provide me with a letter of recommendation for future employment as well as a pat on the back. (I have human needs as well as legal and financial ones, after all.)

I wish to acknowledge that the district provided a finances for an aide, Chris Hardy, not technically qualified but familiar with Laurel and psychologically suited to the job, beginning on March 18th. She has acted not only as aide, but as secretary, researcher, and general drudge, working far more than her allotted six hours per day. Without her perspective, social contact and moral support, I can only guess as to what my mental state would be by now. The program suffered for our trial-and-error approach for the first several weeks, and it could not be said to constitute the &quot;least restrictive and most appropriate environment&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. 

It was not &quot;home-schooling&quot; because it was forced and not voluntary. And it was not &quot;home-bound&quot;, because it was not overseen by a teacher. But it was as appropriate to Laurel&#39;s needs as we could contrive, under the circumstances. 

I look forward to meeting with the school representatives so that we can discuss the most appropriate place for Laurel.

The people were happy with the extra light, and believed that this was all that had been missing. Everything was restored. So they went on, happy with the &#39;&#39;husks of things&#39;&#39; that had once been and were no longer.

The moon gave up her quest to restore the words to life. Yet she could not give up completely. Someday, somehow, she would find the answer.

To safeguard the precious words, she wrapped the moonskin parchment carefully in a silver box and welded the locks shut so it would not open. Then she put the silver box into a slightly larger golden one, then the golden one into an oak box studded with amethyst, then an ebony box studded with sapphires, and finally a box carved from moonstones and lined with the bark of the last moontree. 

She placed this in the bottom of the deepest sea, so that no one would notice it.

I found some great stories though.  One woman &#39;&#39;fought the system&#39;&#39; for years not to institutionalize her cerebral palsied, developmentally disabled child.  She had six other kids and no job.  

Finally, she did give in and send the child to an institution. The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back? Her washing machine broke and she could not afford to replace it.  And the washing by hand was far too much with the child.

Social services was willing to pay the $40,000 a year to institutionalize the child, but not the $600 for a washing machine.

Hi.

Remember that poem you sent me about twelve years ago &#39;&#39;bc*&#39;&#39;, when I kept thinking I was really depressed and &#39;&#39;desperate*&#39;&#39; - the one about waiting because second hand gloves and buds out of season and pain will become interesting again? I just shared that with a friend whose daughter did not quite succeed at commiting suicide.  I can tell you every word and every line in it, but for some reason I can&#39;t remember the author&#39;s name. Would you please give me the &#39;&#39;correct reference*&#39;&#39; so I can credit it appropriately?  I think if I were that guy, just knowing how many lives that poem has saved (or how many times it has saved mine) would be enough to keep him completely happy for the rest of his own life. 

By the way, the &#39;&#39;Depakote&#39;&#39; is not working and the doctor wants Laurel on Lithium starting tomorrow. I need to re-apply for Medicaid because of the possiblity of &#39;&#39;institutionalization&#39;&#39;, and I need to get in touch with Ms. Bradshaw at the school to go over their special education options one more time.  I also want to call the pediatrician tomorrow and ask to have Laurel checked for yeast metabolites and for gliadin anti-bodies. Her behavior is just about as bad as it&#39;s ever been. 

The only way she&#39;ll communicate right now is through pain:   hitting her head against the wall, pushing me backwards into the wall for a shower, pulling my arm for Doritos and chocolate snack puddings, biting my leg for walks. The back of my head is so matted with blood I haven&#39;t brushed my hair in about a week:   I just keep pouring peroxide on it. My arms are bruised, dyed to a hideous purple that would just match that bridesmaid dress from Karen&#39;s wedding. I can still walk, but the pain lately has begun to spring small little sideshows all on its own.
 
I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m numb. Sorry I keep missing your calls. I like you a lot and am not avoiding you.

Promise.

Since before I was born, I have dealt with pain in precisely the same way. It&#39;s a logic function, really. When you believe premise a, then premise b causally follows. The conclusion stems from the tautology:   a = b, b = not c, therefore not c. &#39;&#39;The logic&#39;&#39;, my friend, has always been inescapable.

Pain is of the mind.
The mind refuses to acknowledge the pain.
Therefore, there is no pain.

But sometimes the logic finds a tiny crack in the bars and slowly, grain by grain, escapes into the deep wide wildernesses, leaving only a thin shell of itself behind to guard the pain.

And of course, the pain, freed from its &#39;&#39;overly pedantic jailor&#39;&#39;, goes on holiday. It cannot afford the south of France, so it settles for a wild beer bash, hauling down keggers filled with hopped up spasms, glugging down warm fire gulps of cheap gallows wine.

Then I come in, knocking heads, and bellow:  

The pain is of the mind 
the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain,
therefore there is no pain.

Chastened, the pain cowers back in its cell for a few moments only.

Then it thinks seriously about the situation and decides it is time to become my enemy. It seeps into my body, draping itself sensously around my belly like a diaphonous robe. It settles softly, caressing me, probing for its point of entry.

Finding &#39;&#39;the broken spaces&#39;&#39; on my skin, the pain cinches itself into a wire-bound, scarlet silk corset, the kind with the holes taken out to leave room for the nipple clamps and chains. It knows how to ring my body in fire.

I have become its slave. The only key I hold is my words, repeated now until the fabric of the sound tears with repetition:  

Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain. Pain is of the mind the mind refuses to acknowledge the pain therefore there is no pain.

We never follow this macabre scene to its inescapable, logical conclusion. Rather, something else becomes far more interesting. Janet finds a butterfly and needs to know if the tiny feathers are what holds it together. Laurel decides that now is the perfect time to make a sand castle using all the salt from the salt shaker, which isn&#39;t quite enough, so then she has the sugar and the cat litter on the table too. 

Laurel spins in the living room, weaving yellow and green streamers into the sun, laughing at the light. Janet wants me to join her in a game of Old Maid. Laurel smiles at the air as she watches me watching her.

Our smiles join in over the chorus &#39;&#39;we pretend not to hear&#39;&#39; in the background:

Slowly &#39;&#39;the mantra fades&#39;&#39; as we snuggle down to watch the Muppet movie again. The pain surfaces occasionally, only to fade at the thicket of words now on continuous replay.

It retreats into a darkened den I don&#39;t usually think about. We both know, somehow, that it will return. But Gonzo holds Janet&#39;s face fast as she sings along with the lyrics:   

This looks familiar, vaguely familiar. Almost unreal, yet it&#39;s too soon to feel yet. 

Laurel watches, nuzzling my back like a stray fawn, waiting for shadows she can&#39;t &#39;&#39;quite remember&#39;&#39;.

If you don&#39;t want to be religious, you simply manage to forget that everything has an origin. If you &#39;&#39;can&#39;t afford&#39;&#39; to spend the money on a doctor, or even the two hours it would take for the exam, then you simply manage to forget that pain has an origin. 

If you understand this, then everything is just hunky-dory for the moment.

Because the entire point of pain is to briefly doff its cap to the notion of fair play. 

Ok, buddy, you had &#39;&#39;plenty of warning&#39;&#39;. I tried to tell you. 

Now I can do whatever the hell I want to you.

Ignore the pain at your peril.

Dance around the problems without admitting that something is seriously wrong, and you will pay the piper in coins you cannot possibly imagine-let alone afford.

For pain&#39;s entire intentions are to exact the ultimate &#39;&#39;sacrifice&#39;&#39;.

Last year, when Laurel was out of school for 7 weeks because no classroom was available, I tried to call the Office of Civil Rights. 

The &#39;&#39;number was disconnected&#39;&#39; and no further information is available.

Then I tried to call the Colorado Department of Education. The phone number the Federal agency gave me was incorrect. No further information is available. If you wish to make a call, please hang up and try again.

I have an intimate relationship with the disconnect voice recording.

I got all your good wishes. Thanks guys, for getting those groceries. And all your help.  I sent that letter demanding resources in over a month ago.  I gotta call and bug them, but they seem to be waiting until the meeting day itself.  Also, I am too preoccupied with caring for Laurel to insist on care for Laurel right now.  If you know what I mean.

It&#39;s gonna be a long haul.  

Needless to say, I have had no income while all this is going on. I had to quit my job.   I have been spending quite a bit on academic materials and transporting Laurel to her community activities, and I&#39;ve had to pay a lot more than usual for respite care (when and if I can get it at all), since I don&#39;t have the school days to do my errands. &#39;&#39;Something will provide&#39;&#39;, I&#39;m sure.

Janet is doing pretty well. She wants &#39;&#39;an increased allowance&#39;&#39;. I explained to her the difficulties we are in. She said, well, the government does it, why can&#39;t we? Smart kid.  I think I&#39;ll send her over to the President for some budget lessons.  (Then again, given his rep, maybe not).

Subject: IEP Vocabulary

I&#39;m reading over Laurel&#39;s IEPs and other forms.  Just to see if there is any way we can get help NOW, this year, this minute.

Every other word in this thing is &quot;special.&quot;  Special needs, special education, special considerations.

Most of us have learned to hate the word &quot;special.&quot; It&#39;s kind of like the rape of the word &quot;gay.&quot; Remember when the gay nineties meant the boating parties, the Degas and Renior strokes of lovely, wealthy people enjoying the innocent sun, the happy flowers, the blushing water? Now all gay means is the spectre of death by AIDs, of alternative lifestyles they don&#39;t want in their neighborhood cafes.

Special once conjured up images of scrapbooks, crushed roses from special nights. Then it traveled into the realm of blue plate specials and sank even further into the &#39;&#39;euphemistic depths&#39;&#39;.  

&quot;Special&quot; now means &quot;we don&#39;t want her here.&quot;  Or am I &#39;&#39;being paranoid*&#39;&#39;?

Subject: Somebody get a doctorÑmy sense of humor is terminally ill.

A couple of us were chatting in the AOL chat room the other day and someone typed in that handicapped kids were handicapped because their parents were weird. He/She/It went on to say that this was so obvious, because these parents would do things like laugh hysterically into answering machines, pull their kids out of school for no reason whatsoever, and etc. and etc. This would have probably gone on for a long time, but we were all so busy typing in &#39;&#39;ROTFL ROTFL ROTFL*&#39;&#39; as fast as our giggling fingers would carry us that we paid him/her/it no mind.

Every one knows it is the other way around. Handicapped kids come with your choice of menus:   either take the world seriously and crack up from the insanity juxtaposed upon reality or develop an extremely macabre sense of humor. Unfortunately, every example of humor that struck us as funny struck him/her/it as extremely weird.

Sigh. Some days you can&#39;t &#39;&#39;win for losing&#39;&#39;. (Or doesn&#39;t anyone else find that remotely funny?)

She stared at the dance until &#39;&#39;everything shattered&#39;&#39; into a million, billion stars, each pulling at the tiniest particles, making their own myriads of microcosms.

And the flood of words spilled out from the moon in great joyous torrents, sweeping over the world in cascades of the dark secret moonblood, the sacred red life seeds.

And then the blood came crashing in on wave upon wave. The people understood everything, from the tiniest charmed particle to the largest quasar, from the humblest diatom to the grandest galaxy. And everyone cheered as the moon shared her knowledge freely.

And the words would &#39;&#39;be there forever&#39;&#39; ~ showing each generation what it was to live in the world. What it was to be. 

And the world rejoiced.

And as the flood abated and the sea of words resolved itself into the regular ebb and flow of waves on the rocks, it became apparent just what the moon had done.

For the words held the substance of what was once the world ~ and the world was drained of its joy. 

For nothing can be in two places at once. The choice is between the &#39;&#39;shadows of words&#39;&#39; and the things themselves. And the &#39;&#39;moon&#39;s blood&#39;&#39; was so powerful that the things became words alone and left only the dead shadow husks of themselves behind.

The people saw that they had &#39;&#39;lost something precious&#39;&#39;, but could not remember what it was. So they sacrificed to the moon, once and then one hundred fold. Still, the moon could not return the lost substances. 

And the moon wept.

The stories skirt around the issue; they do not name it. And then the tales came to me in a dream, or maybe a time that was not a dream. I approached an altar, and I saw a &#39;&#39;book*&#39;&#39;, worked in silver thread, written in the moon&#39;s own blood. 

I knew it then. This is the stone treasure the dragon kept watch over, waiting lest anyone approach. This is what all men &#39;&#39;search for&#39;&#39;, though they call it different names: the grail, the golden apples, the ark of the covenant, which disappeared in the destruction of the temple. This is what Laurel needed, the thoughts she was &#39;&#39;so frightened of&#39;&#39;, at the end.

With this gift, I understand.

When we got into the room, the janitor, Mr. Samson,  had Laurel in a head/arm lock in her chair.  The veins in his arms stood blue against the white smooth ivy skin as he held her tight. Samson&#39;s face was a cold mask. He tried to speak, and just sputtered for a minute. Then he stood up slowly and started, &quot;I&#39;ve been a &#39;&#39;punching bag&#39;&#39;.&quot; 

He walked out of the room stiffly, looking back at us at all times. &quot;I&#39;ll...&quot;  But that was all he said.

I have no profound closing comment. I needed to tell someone. If someone out there &#39;&#39;has answers&#39;&#39;, or questions, or sympathy, or even criticism, I&#39;ll take it gratefully. (Not quite as gratefully on the criticism.)

And the moon revelled in the rhythm of the seas. She rejoiced at the people&#39;s happiness--at the splash of the whale&#39;s tail, the flick of a cat&#39;s eye. 
x
She knew, however, that nothing lasts forever~the rapture came from nothingness and would go back to nothingness sooner or later. So she vowed to write it all out~to keep it for posterity. She tried first to describe the world in a single word~but the word became too powerful. So she carefully excised it from all memories--even her own~and began again.

This time, she wrote on &#39;&#39;pages* of pure light&#39;&#39;, using the tips of passing clouds to press the words quickly, quietly into sky. But the words melted as the earth shifted below her, scattering the light. The moon decided to look for something a little &#39;&#39;more substantial&#39;&#39;.

She tried first one plant, then another. First one ink, then another. First fire, then wood, then rocks. Nothing held the words. The writing was nothing like what she had envisioned. It was merely a shadow of the way things were. 

But she could not give up.

Words flowed from the moon&#39;s blood onto the neatly cut pieces of skin. And the moon thought of everything ~ from the soft brush of moonlight on the tip of a gulls wing to the wide curving lips of the earth as it met her each night. She followed rivers to the sea, chronicling each facet on each water-polished rock, each silvered scale on each slippery hidden minnow. She sent the wind to count, and the wind ruffled through each person&#39;s hair, numbering the strands. Her pen marked the curves in each branch, the way each sparrow bounced up and down on its claws ~ first curling to face one way and then with a feather flick facing the other.

All these things the moon wrote. &#39;&#39;And more&#39;&#39;. 

Until the words themselves outnumbered the grains of sands on the beach. Until the moonskin parchment overflowed and the moon&#39;s blood flooded the land.

We had been inside for about two weeks solid.  I finally scraped together a loan from a friend when we started to eat flour and water pancakes spiced with oregano.  The cupboards offered nothing else.

So Laurel and I ventured out to Safeway.  The trip in the car was fine.  No worries.   We managed to get a TON of groceries, Laurel held my hand and protested only once, when I passed up the Pepsi.  She put it in and we went on.  I thought it a small price to pay for peace.

It was only as we were heading for the car that Laurel started in.  I&#39;m not sure &#39;&#39;what sin I committed&#39;&#39;.  It was heinous, though, and Laurel was protesting for all she was worth.  

We got about 20 feet out of the main Safeway entrance - where everyone who was anyone seemed to be that day.  Laurel wrenched herself out of my carefully-tutored hold and threw herself in a writhing, shrieking mass on the ground.  My attempts to regain a hold cost me some hair and a chip off one tooth.  I simply could not get her up.  I determined that my best option would be to back off, signal the traffic to drive around her, and wait until she calmed down.

&#39;&#39;Everyone stared&#39;&#39;.  That&#39;s not a trite statement; I mean at a rate of twenty drivers and maybe sixty pedestrians a minute, every single person bar none stared. They whispered.  They pointed.  My eyes burned.  My stomach churned.  My brain felt like it would split with all the things I wanted to say.

And then I heard the voice.  &quot;Can I help?&quot; it said.  The woman stood not two feet away.  I have a vague impression of a slight, blond creature, her hair making a halo around a face I couldn&#39;t see through a haze of unfallen tears.  I imagined the damage my precious tazmanian devil would do to this small naive creature.  I couldn&#39;t risk the lawsuit.  But somehow my voice found the courage to ask, &quot;Could you please just stand here with me?  So I don&#39;t have to be alone?&quot;

We stood there, on the asphalt.  And I let out all those things I&#39;d been aching to say to the staring faces:  &quot;She&#39;s big for her age, and she&#39;s autistic.  She&#39;s not a brat.  &#39;&#39;She&#39;s frightened and she can&#39;t explain why&#39;&#39;. The world doesn&#39;t make sense to her.  She just needs to feel safe. . . .&quot;  And slowly, an amazing thing began to happen.  The staring faces stopped looking judgmental and condemning and cold.  Each and every one of them was thinking that they wanted to help Ñ they just didn&#39;t know how.  They were afraid they&#39;d embarrass me, or get in the way.  This angel had the grace to speak for the good heart in all humanity, and to let me hear them.

After eight and a half minutes - it sounds like no time at all, but believe me, it&#39;s forever when your kid is lying in the middle of a busy intersection Ñ Laurel calmed down and I walked her to the car.  The angel went into the store.

She only said those three words.  And I wouldn&#39;t recognize her face if I saw her again.  I&#39;d rather hear &quot;Can I help?&quot; than &quot;I love you&quot; any day.  Those are the three most beautiful words in the world.

Dear folks,
This is one year that I can follow in the sacred tradition of crowing and boasting at this time of year.  Mrs. Stegall, Janet&#39;s second grade teacher, asked Janet for a special essay on &quot;her special sister.&quot;  I almost gagged, but let Janet come up with something and send it in.  Mrs. Stegall is going to print it in the school newsletter and use it as a shining example of student writing.  She even suggested putting Janet in a gifted and talented class.  She says that the &#39;&#39;regular classroom*&#39;&#39; won&#39;t allow Janet to reach her full potential.  Janet says she wants to go to it because her best friend Carina is in it. I said fine.  

Janet can write quite well when she puts her mind to it - she would write a paragraph or so, go out to jump rope, come back in, go hang out on the tree (even in this frost - I think she talks to the &#39;&#39;snow gods&#39;&#39; or something and they keep her warm).  Then she would write a bit more.

I asked her where she learned this piecemeal approach to writing, and she said, from you mommy.  

Which, when I look at &#39;&#39;things around here&#39;&#39;, is nothing less than the absolute truth.

We were quiet for a moment, watching the traffic pass us.

Laurel&#39;s escalating violence in the grocery stores, parks, and cars has made me desparate not only for her safety, but for Janet&#39;s.  Janet is great about &#39;&#39;disappearing from view*&#39;&#39; when her presence is just another threat on the horizon.  Her uncanny sixth sense lets her appear just in time to take over some of the necessary functions of life (like paying the cashier for our groceries or answering the door and keeping our sanctity safe from random Jehovah&#39;s witnesses, newspaper collections, and Amway distributors).

Still, I can&#39;t help thinking she&#39;d be better off elsewhere, especially right now. It can&#39;t be good for any child to see her mother holding down her sister (no matter what the provocation, and believe me, I have much more provocation than most).  It is also probably pretty frightening to see me with blood running down my neck and shoulders or missing chunks of hair.  (At any rate, if I saw someone looking like me, I&#39;d be terrified).  To put the final cap on it, I can&#39;t give Janet &#39;&#39;the attention*&#39;&#39; she needs. I think she &#39;&#39;understands this better*&#39;&#39; now that she is older, but I feel horribly guilty when I can&#39;t spare the time for her.  &#39;&#39;Who can she be*&#39;&#39; if she grows up like this?

I called my sister,  Kelly,  last night and asked if she and her husband and her 8-year-old daughter would take Janet for a while. She said they&#39;ll talk it over and get back to me. But now they live in Riverside, CA, which is gang-ridden and smoggy, and 1,200 miles from here. I&#39;m not sure what I feel. I think she would be happier. I&#39;m not sure I would be.

This may be the temporary answer we all need. But somehow, I can&#39;t see sending my kids away. Not either of them.

How many children do I have?

I&#39;m going to have time for Janet.  But Laurel needs me right now.  I keep hearing about how urgent Laurel&#39;s situation is, how intensive, early intervention is the only hope for her.  And there is hope, I am assured.  But it takes a lot.  Either it&#39;s expensive, or it takes every waking moment, or both. But &#39;&#39;she&#39;ll get better&#39;&#39;!  Just do the Lovaas program every waking moment for a year!  Just put her on Super NuThera, and DMG and melatonin... and inositol.  Just find an opthalmologist who prescribes Irlen lenses!  Just get AIT!  Just spend $4,000 on neurobiofeedback!  Just do the SonRise program!  Just find a doctor who&#39;ll prescribe Secretin... or Ritalin... or Risperdal.  Do a &#39;&#39;rotation diet*&#39;&#39;.  Learn to cook without any wheat or dairy products.  Just do this for a few months, or a few years, and she&#39;ll be fine.  Then you&#39;ll have time for your other child.

And maybe that happened for other kids.  But it never happened for Laurel.  And all Janet&#39;s ever known is &quot;just wait. . .just wait. . .just wait. . . .&quot;

Janet and I were walking out by the Highline canal, and Laurel was peacefully running in circles beside us.  I asked Janet who she was, &#39;&#39;how did she define herself&#39;&#39; at school?

She said that sometimes at school she would say she was Laurel&#39;s sister, because everyone knew Laurel.  The teachers would say, well, you certainly are as pretty as Laurel.  &#39;&#39;One old witch*&#39;&#39; told her that she was so much better behaved that there was no way that she and Laurel could be related.  

I asked Janet again, who she was.  Who would she be without Laurel?  Janet shrugged and waded into the shallow part of the canal, reaching for a cattail.  Snapped it off with a force that left half of the roots exposed.  Twirling it  like a baton, she came back to me.   

I define myself as Janet Murphy that&#39;s all I can say, she said, and twisted the cattail very slightly, so a velvet explosion of seeds emerged and spilled off her hand.  I asked her who Janet Murphy was.  She blew the seeds toward the sun, toward Laurel.

I dunno, she said. Maybe just:
Spelling bee champ.
The girl with the purple toenail polish.
The kid with the best time on the 50 yard dash.
The kid that Amanda always picks on.

Laurel watched her as the millions of seeds blew out from the single stalk, fascinated.

I talked it over with Janet last night, long after her bedtime.   My sister Kelly would be happy to take Janet for the summer, maybe even for next year.  This would ensure that Janet doesn&#39;t get hurt in the cross fire, and that she can do &#39;&#39;normal things*&#39;&#39;.  

Janet flatly refused.  &quot;I can&#39;t live without you, Mom&quot; she said, crossing her arms and frowning back into her pillows.

I asked her why.

&quot;I can&#39;t sleep without a hug at night from you.  I need your protection.&quot;  Janet wriggled around until she could lay her head in my lap and look up at me.

I asked her from what. 

She thought about it for a while, her eyes closed.  &quot;From everything.  From mean Mrs. McDougal down the street.  From the ghost trees in the park.  &#39;&#39;From the moon&#39;&#39;.&quot;

I held her close.  Looks like we aren&#39;t going anywhere, folks.

I picked Janet up from first grade the other day.  It had been an aggressive day for Laurel, so we were just taking it easy and mellow, walking around slow. I walked Laurel into the playground as I was just a bit early and we both waited for her class to come out.  As Laurel had the playground all to herself, she went up the slide and back down, up the swings and back down, on the see-saw and back down, in a regular, monotonous circuit.  Each step was precisely the same length, each action precisely the same - &#39;&#39;a playground ritual&#39;&#39;.

The kids came streaming out of the double doors and Laurel got frightened.  So she quickly completed her last circuit and came over to me, trembling.  She started to flap her arms and hum loudly, tapping her forehead into my upper thigh.

Janet and a few girls from her class walked over to us.  

&quot;Who is that?&quot; a girl asked, twirling a strand of her peach and grape colored hair. 

&quot;That is my sister, Laurel&quot; Janet said, her arm on Laurel&#39;s possessively.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with  her?&quot; was the next query.  

Janet launched into the whole spiel:  &quot;There is nothing wrong with her.  She just has &#39;&#39;autism&#39;&#39;.  Autism is when someone takes out your brain, puts it in a blender and tries to put it back in and connect everything up, but gets it all wrong.&quot;  

I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.  The girls said, ok and wanted to know if Laurel had any of the latest Power Rangers or Pogs and if so would she share them.

I said no, but offered to bring in cookies.  This was acceptable to all concerned.

They tell you kids learn to love to read if they see their parents reading.  Janet almost never saw me without a book or magazine in my hands.  I read everything the library had on autism.  Then I subscribed to the Autism Society newsletters, and the Autism Research Review.  Janet  would ask what I was doing, and I&#39;d tell her about &#39;&#39;the fascinating book or article&#39;&#39; I was reading.

One summer day, Janet came up to me as I sat reading on the steps.  She pulled something invisible out of the imaginary pocket of her diaper and commanded, &quot;Read this!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked.

&quot;A magazine,&quot; was her calm reply.

&quot;What&#39;s it about?&quot;

&quot;ME!&quot;

&#39;&#39;I got the message.&#39;&#39;

Laurel is finally &#39;&#39;out of the cast&#39;&#39; and her leg is fine.  She twirls around in the middle of the loving room floor until she is too dizzy to stand.  Then she plops down anywhere and sits quietly.  I think I can still see her eyes spinning sometimes.

Anyway, Janet has taken a motherly interest in seeing that Laurel stays healthy.   She has devised an exercise program.  At first, I thought this was cute and sweet and utterly harmless.  It seems I still have a lot to learn about children (and here I thought I was in the advanced class).

Janet is teaching Laurel how to climb walls.  You start with one foot on the air vent, put both hands on the walls, put other foot up on the wall, use that to prop yourself  up, and presto! all four digits are on a vertical surface. From there you can climb over to the sofa, bounce a couple of times, and come down on the other side of the wall.  If you push yourself off the sofa at just the right angle, you can safely propel yourself to the floor and declare yourself a champion wall climber.  If you &#39;&#39;miscalculate the trajectory&#39;&#39;, you will not have the breath to say anything.

I told Janet that climbing walls was probably not a good thing to do until at least a month after you were out of a cast.  She took me seriously and marked the date that Laurel could climb walls on the calendar.  I think I am hoping she will just forget about it by then.  And that the adventure du jour then is not quite as haphazardly dangerous to flesh and furniture.

How much do padded rooms cost, anyway?  And are they cheaper if you buy two?

Moonsisters, she replied.

Monsters like Dracula, werewolves, or yeerks I asked, hoping I had misheard her.

No. Moon sisters.  Laurel is from the Moon and &#39;&#39;I am her sister&#39;&#39;, so we are moonsisters.

Subject: Just like a normal kid

This started out to be a bright and beautiful March Sunday. The kids and I slept late, but instead of going straight to the sugar cereals and videos, both Janet and Laurel got dressed and went outside to play in the brisk, calm air. Janet kept running in with this new blade of grass, a possible sighting of a robin, and reports of crocuses in Mrs. Cooper&#39;s yard.

Things looked great. I had a few moments to me and I was planning my spending spree of time. I was going to take a long shower, watch &quot;Roseanne&quot;, read some Piers Anthony, play a coupla games with the babies. But first I went to check on Laurel. She was on the roof. Her hands were artistically splayed above her head, her feet in a classic ballarina&#39;s pose (the fifth position, I think). And she was leaning way too far to the other side.  You know how in those moments everything is supposed to go in slow motion? Well, it didn&#39;t.

Laurel took a flying leap, chortled, and jumped  off the other side of the house. I made record time getting to her, throwing old tricycles, pop cans, half a lawnmower, and other urban detritus out of the way. She was sitting quite still, &#39;&#39;stunned&#39;&#39;, with her arms wrapped around her chest, which was unusual for her. She let me kneel by her side and help her to her feet, but she couldn&#39;t put any weight on her left foot. She had that peculiar, jagged breathing that makes me think of broken bones. 

Dad sped over to sit on Janet. Chris shoved her husband, Rob out the door to help me take Laurel to the Emergency Room. I suggested we take two cars, but Rob said there was no chance he was leaving until the last paper was signed, so we just took mine. 

Laurel adapted beautifully to maneuvering herself from the car to a wheelchair. She didn&#39;t want to lie down, didn&#39;t trust that big machine that the radiology tech said, &quot;won&#39;t hurt.&quot; But with the help of a little tylenol and codeine, and an inflated surgical glove, she decided she could hang out for a little while. The x-rays didn&#39;t show any breaks, but the ER doc said that kids&#39; breaks often don&#39;t show, especially not within the first hours after the injury. 

Nonetheless, ER doc said that the degree of pain Laurel is showing indicates &#39;&#39;a probable break&#39;&#39;. The nurse announced she was going to put a splint on Laurel&#39;s foot. Laurel shook her head &quot;no&quot; so hard her hair whapped her chin. I explained that this probably wasn&#39;t the best idea, as if Laurel didn&#39;t want it, she certainly would have it off in about two nanoseconds flat.

The nurse muttered under her breath that she could certainly understand that, but asked if we could just keep an eye on Laurel so she wouldn&#39;t tear the cast off. After all, it would only be for about three weeks. Chris, Rob, and I started &#39;&#39;laughing hysterically&#39;&#39;. It had taken all three of us to keep an eye on her in the emergency room  how did the nurse think we were going to do it after we got her home??? 

After we calmed down a bit, the ER doc said that if she didn&#39;t have at least a splint, then the bone would not heal properly and we would probaly have to rebreak it and reset it. I asked if we could create some sort of bandage that would keep the bones together and still be impossible for a very active, highly adept seven-year-old to take off. The doc, bless his heart, came up with a steel cage-like thing that he locked around Laurel&#39;s shin and ankle. Then he put the plaster on top of that. There was no way that she could get her hands under the plaster and steel. So this worked out well. We applauded. He bowed.

Laurel tolerated it &#39;til we got to the car. Then she started screaming and banging her leg on the front seat. Chris and Rob climbed in back to hold her. Laurel clopped Chris on the chin with the cast  a heavy clomp. We thought we&#39;d have to go back into the emergency room, but Chris announced that she&#39;d survive. 

After we got home, Laurel needed to &quot;undo&quot; the imbalance of having gone out the back and off the front of the house. On her one good foot, she found it necessary to climb over the fence. Twice. Rob completely disapproved. And helped. I carried Laurel through the back yard and into the house. Then she was fine, and allowed me to carry her to the shower where she could just wet her upper body and good leg, to the kitchen for a bedtime snack, and into her room to bed. I am one pooped puppy. I&#39;m going to look into borrowing a wheelchair for her. But right now, I&#39;m going to bed.

Subject: Houdini&#39;s end.

Laurel ran off again today. While I was washing dishes, she planned her escape. The child has been watching David Copperfield, or maybe old movies of Houdini (I don&#39;t know, did they really make old movies of Houdini?). She must be emulating someone, surely this couldn&#39;t come out of one innocent child&#39;s own head! She left the water running in ythe sink, and the noise hid the slight noises as she dragged the chair to the door, clambered up, and de-activated the alarm Rob installed for me just last week.  Mission accomplished, she slipped out the door, left the house barefoot and ran out into the ice and snow, making a bee-line for the grocery store and Colorado Boulevard . 

I noticed a green flash outside the window and instictively ran to the door. This day, my &#39;&#39;self-preservation genes&#39;&#39; were kicking in--I stopped to get shoes. By the time I looked up (5 nanoseconds later, I am really getting to be a fast-change artist), she was nowhere to be seen. So I ran out to the car, which wouldn&#39;t start, natch.  No one else was around (it was about noon-thirty, and Janet had gone off with the Coopers for a day trip to Keystone--the Coopers paid for her day skiing and sledding as a Christmas present-but I digress). 

So I ran after the &#39;&#39;footprints in the snow&#39;&#39; (we&#39;d gotten about 4 inches the day before this). I saw her green dress in the snow just this side of Colorado Boulevard, and ran like hell to get to her. But I slipped on the ice and skidded. Pain surrounded me with its sudden, final dictatorship. 

I could not get up off the ground. 

I could not move. 

I could only watch with horror as she sat down and slid into the busy road. I knew no one would see her. I knew this was the end.

Subject: A haunting tale

I probably should tell you guys all this because you are my friends and you care and besides I just like to babble on hearing about my own voice.  It doesn&#39;t really matter that you are all so far away from me, and that the only lines of communication we have are these little plastic boxes and silver lines. I have felt and appreciated and sent virtual hugs to each one of you... and I do so need your hugs now. Now that it is all over of course. 

Let me begin at the beginning of this sordid little tale. Laurel and some other kids go swimming every Tuesday at the Y. She loves the water, and I love just watching her little yellow cap bobbing up and down through the chlorine green.  This is the one and only time she will stand for anything on her head--I think she follows the electorial philosophy of suffering the lesser evil--a thick plastic cap or water in her ears and eyes.  

Her &#39;&#39;rituals&#39;&#39; are worthy of a choir spot on Ethel Merman&#39;s shows, supposing the lines of time and space could be warped enough to bring that about. Laurel swims in a four foot circle in the shallow part, her head barely below the water, her arms holding her knees as she kicks silently. When the water sprays, she stops circling and stands for a moment, letting the water just lap into the kelly green top of her one piece.

The other kids form rings around the rosy, stick their feet up through the air in the shallow part, and hunt monsters down as long as their breath holds them together. Laurel ignores them entirely. She is much more interested in her own little pockets of posy, her poses and pirouettes.

Anyway, I really am getting to my point, because I always have at least one. Anyway again, last Tuesday Laurel must have gotten tired of swimming and got out of the pool early. I hadn&#39;t looked at her for about 3 or 4 minutes, and she was just gone. This was deeply scary. I took a breath and ran into the ladies room. No Laurel. Went into the men&#39;s room. No Laurel. Lots of strange looks, and even one wolf whistle, but no Laurel.

Then I ran out barefoot in 30-degree weather trying to catch her. I ran forever, and finally my lungs filled with fire and air refused to move through me. Then I saw Laurel--only a block and a half away, the yellow bathing cap jumping up and down like the little jump stick dolls they used to have when everybody who is older than the hills grew up. (which just dates me, but anyway I&#39;m getting to the scary part here, so just hold your breath folks).

This is the scary part:  My side cramped so badly I could not move. And &#39;&#39;no one would help me&#39;&#39;.

Our local BDSM (Bondage and Discipline, Sado-Masochism) store. The people there are incredibly friendly, extremely knowledgeable about every possible type of &#39;&#39;safe restraint&#39;&#39;. They are beginning to know me quite well, actually. I keep recommending them to other moms, school districts, and friends, but no one can quite get up the courage to enter the shop. 

I will admit that the chain bikinis and nipple clamps in the window are a wee bit intimidating.  Nonetheless, if I can brave a roomful of administrators, educators, and psychologists for my child, I can &#39;&#39;brave&#39;&#39; anything.

Echololia is a repeating sound. The child might say something she heard before in that spot or in another location. For example, if a teacher said &quot;Let&#39;s go for a walk&quot; three months ago and then proceeded to get a drink of water, the child might say &quot;Let&#39;s go for a walk&quot; when she really wants a drink of water.

Needless to say, this repetition creates &#39;&#39;more of a mystery&#39;&#39; than it solves.

Hi Friends! Laurel has been using a rental wheelchair for the past five days. I managed to get her one the morning after she &#39;&#39;jumped off the roof&#39;&#39;. The cast is still on, but she doesn&#39;t seem to feel the pain when she walks. So she has walked a bit, been surprised when her leg does not work, sat a bit, forgot about it, and walked a bit more. To combat this, I went down to the &#39;&#39;Crypt*&#39;&#39; to get some restraints and tie her into the chair. Unfortunately, I got only the buckle kind, not the lock and key kind.

Today, as I was working on a business letter, not ten feet from where I&#39;d tied Laurel to the chair, I realized I hadn&#39;t heard from her for about ten minutes. I looked at her chair. Nothing there. I pulled my heart down from the ceiling and went outside--merely to find the little bugger climbing back onto the roof! Expletive deleted! I rushed up onto the roof before realizing that I am terrified of heights. The rolling in the stomach. The pressing behind the eyes as you realize two totally separate, simultaneous states of reality: 

   1. It is high up here.

   2. There is no phone on the roof.

I choked back my screams and started toward Laurel, crooning in my most comforting &#39;&#39;voice&#39;&#39;, &quot;peanut, peanut butter, peanut peanut butter,&quot; over and over again. This helped some. At least, I felt calmer. Laurel stayed just a few inches away from me during all of this, slowly and steadiy climbing higher on the tarry, grey-and-red pebbled shingles. Her cast made scratchy noises, light scraping against my nerves. The sandpaper roughness was just enough to catch the edges of my fear. 

Laurel, of course, felt none of this. Finally she reached the apex of the roof and straddled it like a horse. Then she patted the roof and said &quot;Gee go,&quot; which is what I say when I let her on the penny-a-ride horse in the front of the Super KMart. I wasn&#39;t sure if the &#39;&#39;echololia*&#39;&#39; was good right here or not. In any other circumstances, I would have been wallowing ecstatically in the sound of &#39;&#39;Laurel&#39;s voice&#39;&#39;. The vertigo in my stomach kept my mind on the current matter.

I didn&#39;t dare get any closer, as Laurel was only two feet from the edge of the roof. She looked back at me and giggled. I shouted for Janet and bless her, she came running in from playing with her friend Carina about two doors up. Carina ran to get her father, Mr. &#39;&#39;Fisher&#39;&#39;. Mr. Fisher came over in his bare feet and terry cloth robe. That is the great thing about my neighbors, they know that when I call, it really IS an emergency.

Laurel and I sat up there for about fifteen minutes while Mr. Fisher, on my instructions, set up the ladder. Janet climbed up (I didn&#39;t want to risk anyone who wasn&#39;t a family member), and set out a trail of orange Starburst candies--one for every two shingles on the shortest way down to the ladder. 

Hey, don&#39;t knock bribery. It worked! Laurel was mostly crawling once she got back inside, but the cast seemed to hold up pretty well. With that steel lining, it should hold up against practically anything--up to and including a nuclear disaster.

You have to run after your child and you cannot run.

You have to lift her up and you cannot lift her up.

You have to find the &#39;&#39;money&#39;&#39; to feed here and there is &#39;&#39;no money&#39;&#39;.

In one horrible, lung-fire-filled instant, every idea I had about keeping her safe for her whole life &#39;&#39;vanished&#39;&#39; from every known universe.

I did not want to get up from the ice to save my child. My hip was on fire, my face flush with gravel. And in that second, I could see Laurel&#39;s funeral. Could feel the relief. There would be time for a shower, time for a sit down meal, time to read more than 2 pages of a book. I could work, get some money in a retirement account, send Janet to college. In short, a life like anyone else&#39;s--a life which seemed so far out of reach now. And all I had to do to get it was give into the throbbing pain and simply not get up.

I closed my eyes against the guilt this brought out. This was surely the right thing to do. Surely no one would have to suffer anymore.

I cried as if she were &#39;&#39;already dead&#39;&#39;.

I knew I could do this. I began to know the strength of my cells when my child first formed and my cells took everything to nourish her cells. 

When my blood spilled out from the birth pains, when my body heaved and every muscle, every tendon bore down to force my child into the light, I knew. From then on, my body would do anything to protect my child. 

My cells would take &#39;&#39;power from beyond&#39;&#39; themselves, gather it, and save it for when my child cried out.

I tell her I have the strength to hold her and I clutch at her chest, holding her tightly against me. Sometimes she clutches back. Sometimes she wanders away, her eyes caught in the moonlight.

Subject: Cliffhanger ending

Sorry about that cliffhanger there. While I was typing, Laurel had gotten out of her room and was decorating the hallway in a tasteful shade of peanut butter and broken glass.  This would have been ok, except that the floor had to be decorated to match, and she was barefoot. We got the glass out of her foot and she insisted on putting the &#39;&#39;bloody glass&#39;&#39; onto the wall-where it belonged. I will wait until she falls asleep to clean up the mess.

So, needless to say, Laurel is still very much alive. The gas station attendant on Monaco knows us pretty well. Luckily, Laurel was in his line of sight (about 50 feet away). He saw what was going on, left his store, and ran out to grab Laurel.

Laurel bit him. He held on and grasped her shoulders. Laurel struggled. He pulled her up off the sidewalk and dragged her into the gas station. Not daring to let go because he feared my darling daughter would bite again, he yelled at a customer to call 911. The customer, a big burly guy about 6 feet 6 or so grabbed Laurel&#39;s legs, which were kicking faster than a helicopter&#39;s propellers and doing just about as much damage to the gas station attendant&#39;s snow-caked legs. Another customer, a small black-haired lady, saw only a small portion of what was going on, drew her own conclusions, and called 911 to report a burglary in progress. 

In the meantime, I was still on the ground about 100 yards away from the gas station, trying to get up. My hip was simply not cooperating and was perusing &#39;&#39;travel brochures&#39;&#39; for the Caribbean or maybe even Tahiti.

So I started to crawl toward the gas station, calling out that Laurel was autistic and was not going to hurt anyone. I could not see what was going on.

The cops came when I was about on the 60 yard line and crawling for the tackle. I was still sliding on the snow, and snow had come in through various convenient portions of my jeans and was melting/freezing other unmentionable parts of my anatomy. 

I called out as the cop entered the store, but he was much too interested in the burglary. I don&#39;t know what was said in there, but I can imagine, as the cop was out in about a minute, scouring the street for me. I called out again and he came over. He said not to move, and he called the paramedics. I told him my daughter was autistic, and could not speak or reason (which is a bit of a lie, but under the circumstances was the easiest thing to say). He said that everything was under control there and not to worry.

&#39;&#39;I kept crawling forward anyway&#39;&#39;.

He sighed and said, &quot;Well, if that&#39;s the way you want it, lady.&quot; and gave me a hand up. We covered the last 50 yards and when I got into the store, I could see Laurel was calming down. So I said that I could hold her and took over from the burly customer. Laurel immediately wriggled out of my grasp, grabbed a Pepsi from the display, and started chugging it. At that point, I found I had forgotten my wallet. The gas station attendant said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, lady. I&#39;ll catch you next time.&quot; I tried to tell him how grateful I was and he just said, &quot;Merry Christmas, ma&#39;am.&quot;

The paramedics checked out my hip, pronounced it merely bruised, and left without a bill when they figured out what was going on. 

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

After I asked Dad why he hadn&#39;t told me &#39;&#39;that story.&#39;&#39; Just being curious.

Dad said he thought I had other things on my mind that day and didn&#39;t need to hear that story. I explained to him that it meant a lot to me to know that he knew some of what I went through. He said he admires &#39;&#39;the commitment&#39;&#39; I have to my kids, and the patience I show with both of them. : *)

I hung up the phone and hugged Janet. She asked me what that was for, and I told her that I appreciated, loved, and admired her. I told Laurel the same thing. She hummed and took my hand over to the refrigerator for a Pepsi.

Subject: How to get arrested without really trying

Ooo, I wish this was a funny story, like the Monty Python sketch. Then I could shout the punchline at the top of my lungs and everyone would laugh along with it.

OTOH, you may find new appreciation for your folks...

Dad asked me to look after his three tanks of fish (a beta, some neons and some discus) and two parakeets while he was out of town for three weeks. 

Dad didn&#39;t call to check in at any point during his trip. He hadn&#39;t actually left me a key to his house. (No, no! That&#39;s just what they&#39;d be expecting!) I could practically hear desperate little fish voices crying for food as I circled the place, pushing windows, sliding my library card along door cracks, the girls trailing behind me with a rising murmur that bespoke louder protestations to come if something sensible didn&#39;t happen soon. So I finally broke a small window in the side of the house and climbed in, leaving Janet and Laurel out in his backyard. Janet found a compost heap and started digging, while Laurel hummed the tune for &quot;&#39;&#39;Peanut, peanut butter&#39;&#39;&quot; at the top of her lungs.

Naturally enough, the next door neighbor called the cops. After all, who would break into someone&#39;s back window at seven o&#39;clock at night, yelling idiotic lyrics? Obviously, it had to be someone who was &#39;&#39;mentally disturbed&#39;&#39;, at the very least. It&#39;s a great neighborhood; by the time I let the girls in, there was a knock at the door. I open up the front door, and the cop has his gun partway drawn. (I guess you never know what you&#39;re going to find with a call like that.)  Laurel, eagle-eyed child that she is, saw the glittery flash and dove for it. Bless the guardian angel on duty, I caught her before she could grab the pistol or I don&#39;t want to think what would have happened. Her momentum spun the two of us around in a complete circle, which confused the cop for a moment. 

The cop, a big burly man who resembled nothing more than an overgrown cigar, gave out in a deep, gruff voice, &quot;Ma&#39;am, we&#39;ve had a report of a disturbance here are you the owner of the house?&quot;

I say, &quot;No, I&#39;m his daughter.&quot; 

The guy shifted on his heels and said, &quot;Can I see some i.d.?&quot;

I tell him its in the car. He thinks it would be just spiffy if he went with me to get it. On the way, he notices the window, which is backlit from the light in the hallway. He says, &quot;What happened here?&quot; in a voice that said he was likely to cart all of us off at any moment.

I told him the story, showed my i.d. He called in on his computer, matching my license. Then he said he&#39;d escort me through the house to see if we could find some verifying evidence. I said ok. We went back in. While we&#39;d been so pleasantly chatting outside, Laurel had discovered art supplies and gone waltzing through the house decorating Dad&#39;s priceless oriental rugs with tastefully applied tessalations of Ked prints in Colgate. The cop looked ready to add vandalism to my obviously growing list of crimes. 

How we got through all that, you don&#39;t want to know. Neural defenses are blurring the details in my mind even as I write. I seem to recall a toppled file cabinet, a broken toe (the cop&#39;s, not any of ours), several packages of orange &#39;&#39;starbursts&#39;&#39; (to get Laurel into the shower so she would stay there while I cleaned up the rugs), and two late-night trips to &#39;&#39;Rug Doctors*&#39;&#39;.

The cop was back outside when we finally finished cleaning and feeding and leaving. He was writing me a ticket for an expired emissions sticker. Apparently, my sense of self-preservation had also expired, because I explained to the cop that this was a shitty thing to do to an &#39;&#39;obviously-frazzled mother&#39;&#39; at this particular hour, and that protection and service would be better defined by arresting drunk drivers than by exercising a personal vendetta for his fractured toe and bruised ego by abusing his authority to make people&#39;s lives miserable by picking on minutia.

This was a mistake. 

We all piled in his car and went down to the station for disturbing the peace. I decided I might as well relax and enjoy the relative safety. My head dropped back. My eyes closed for just a moment. Laurel saw her opportunity to bring out the kidnapped Colgate and add some needed artistic flare to the partition. This particular cop does not appreciate fine art. He was able to add vandalism of a state vehicle to the list of &#39;&#39;charges*&#39;&#39;.

They tried to take the girls into another room, but Laurel started slamming her head into a wall, so they brought her back to me. The cop apparently had noticed the odd behavior he never quite commented on, and a representative of the &#39;&#39;Child Protection Gestapo&#39;&#39; was sent for. She glanced over the papers, tossed a cat-like smile in my direction and told the sergeant, &quot;We are aware of this family. We don&#39;t want these children.&quot; And she left.

I&#39;m not entirely sure whether I feel relieved or appalled.


Ok. Ok. To make a long story even longer, we got home around 3 am.

Subject: This parrot is deceased. DEAD. Passed on.

Remember the housebreaking incident? Loud and clear, I am sure. I shall remember it every other Saturday for the next two months, as I have to go in for probation -- dragging the girls along with me. I pleaded guilty to &#39;&#39;disturbing the peace&#39;&#39; in return for them dropping the vandalism. They didn&#39;t press the child-abuse suspicions, but it must have been in the report because I got the feeling the judge wants the probation officer to observe us for any further signs of insanity.

To sum up the rest of the horrors, Laurel delighted in dumping out the bird seed and water. She managed to do it just as we were leaving, so I didn&#39;t notice that the parakeets had a wet cage. The green parakeet developed tracheitis, clicking and wheezing, and I spent $81 at the vet. The kids also managed to break three feeder tubes at $3.50 each. I guess we won&#39;t get us any birds anytime soon. 

Further three of the discus (discusses? disci?) died, after Janet turned the thermometer down. (&quot;But I thought they might be hot in the water and would want to cool off,&quot; she told me. I told her that fish like different &#39;&#39;environments*&#39;&#39; than humans.) and I had to replace them at $45 a pop. The lady at Pet World told me I was lucky they were not larger--these fish can run up to $150 to $200 for the pancake-sized fish. 

Dad came back from his trip around midnight, and came over straight to our house for the key he left with us. I told him, wiping sleep out of my eyes, that he hadn&#39;t left one. He pestered, (text-colour:red)[&quot;Are you sure?&quot;] and proceeded to look through the house, flipping on lights and clanging around so that Laurel woke up and started howling in her room--as if we would lose something like that on purpose. I told him,(text-colour:navy)[&quot;Yes dammit!&quot;] As he was telling me not to swear, he looked in his briefcase--where his keys had been for his entire trip. He said nothing. I told him about having to break into his house and about the cops. He said (text-colour:red)[&quot;You should have just called them in the first place.&quot;] (This is true, which totally pisses me off.) (text-colour:red)[ &quot;Did you get the window fixed yet?&quot;] When I admitted I had not, he said, (text-colour:red)[&quot;Well, you can take care of it tomorrow.&quot;]

I handed Dad the veterinary paperwork (the doctor&#39;s diagnosis, care instructions and the bill). He also said that, as for the green parakeet, (text-colour:red)[&quot;I would have &#39;&#39;let it die&#39;&#39;, and hoped it was contagious. I didn&#39;t tell you to go to the vet, so I won&#39;t pay for that.&quot;] I told him that was just fine with me. He left. 

This is a man who volunteers for the library and ships the left-over books from the annual book sale to third world countries. He sponsored an immigrant family from Cameroon. He goes to the Philipines once a year to do surgery in back-woods communities with no medical facilities. He invests in real estate and gives me a home to live in. But...&#39;&#39;he is such....a jerk!&#39;&#39;

Dad had neatly labeled his discus tank with their colors: turquoise, cobalt, and pigeon blood. The fish turned in the water, their scales shimmering iridescent in the fluorescent light.

Laurel stayed far away from the tank--the humming of the lights, I think, hurt her ears.

&#39;&#39;Janet&#39;&#39; and I watched for a while, fascinated. 

The pigeon blood one caught our eyes and held them tight. She swam up to the top, light shining through the red-blood of her scales, gasping for air with a thin open mouth.

The blood rushed down to feed on the orange-and blue stones, then back to the light with a single minded ferocity.

We watched for what must have been forever, our whole beings caught in the flame of her &#39;&#39;captive blood&#39;&#39;.

The funny thing was when this all started, I thought I could count on people. Obviously, I reasoned, the Social Services, those &#39;&#39;boogy monsters&#39;&#39; of my childhood, were really reasonable (although slightly overworked) human beings. They could direct me to places to get training, help for Laurel. After all, dear, they are professionals, some nurse or other told me.

But they didn&#39;t know. When I called upon &#39;&#39;the power of social services&#39;&#39;, the hydra came alive - each head spitting a different venom: 

&#39;&#39;* Abandonment&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;* Censure&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;* Helplessness&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;* Freudian Blame&#39;&#39;

Buried deep within Bruno Bettleheim&#39;s Etiology and Treatment section in the &#39;&#39;Empty Fortress*&#39;&#39; is a grudging acceptance that &quot;it serves no good purpose to make the parents of autistic children feel guilty as having caused the disturbance.&quot; (page 403). But his next &#39;&#39;words betray this&#39;&#39;, as he so fairly points out that he cannot be sure that the parent&#39;s attitudes (read mother here) were enough by themselves to cause the problem. On the next page, he magnanimously declares that &quot;While we believe it [parental attitudes] to be a precipitating factor, this makes it only a necessary but not sufficient condition&quot;  So, to interpret this, we work backwards.  The simplified logic here goes like this:

1. Something is wrong with the child
2. As children interact with their environment, something is wrong with the environment
3. Children interact most with parents.
4. Therefore &#39;&#39;something must be wrong&#39;&#39; (the necessary condition) with the mother&#39;s attitudes and actions.
5. This may not be enough to cause the problem, but it is obviously there (Conclusion from 1 - 4)

This logic has embedded in it a course of treatment: &quot;...find out what experiences may have caused or contributed to infantile autism&quot; (page 404). The path is quite clear: &quot;whether we learn to understand infantile autism depends on whether or not we treat autistic children in ways that parallel Freud&#39;s&quot; (page 405).  Of course, we can&#39;t do that at home, because home is where the problem is. We take the defective child, subject it to intense psychotherapy. At the same time, we take the mother on a pyschoanalytical hunt through her past to determine what went wrong. 

Ironically, Bettleheim boasts that this way is the only way to promote hope for if we believe (like some of his colleagues) that autism is an innate disorder, we will give up. Maybe in the sixties we did give up, we did keep children with spina bifida and cerebral palsy and other physical ailments in institutions. Things won&#39;t get any better, so warehouse them while you still can. But do we &#39;&#39;still give up so easily&#39;&#39; in this more enlightened age?

Re: Memory files
Date: Fall 1993

I need to remember how Laurel got &#39;&#39;sidestreamed*&#39;&#39;.  It is important to understand each step, each stage of the fall.

Kindegarten. No. Kindegarten went well. Laurel learned to play with other kids and to take turns. She even made a few friends who came over for her birthday party. It was first grade. Yes.

After Laurel&#39;s delightful success in kindegarten, I anticipated a smooth first grade year. I had not yet developed the art of cynicism. The first grade teacher was wonderful. She was 62 years old and had been teaching forever because she loved it. She was animated and gentle and cheerful. But, she confided in me (in the parking lot - not in the conference room, of course) she had never had an autistic child in her class and &#39;&#39;didn&#39;t want one now&#39;&#39;.

&quot;They should have told me a year ago that she would be here so that I could take special classes and learn how to teach her. But I don&#39;t want to spend a year learning how to teach her. If I did,&quot; she said, sealing the logic of her argument, &quot;I&#39;d have been a different kind of teacher all along.&quot;

I went in to observe. Laurel ran through that class like a bull in a china shop. She played with the kids&#39; hair, untied their shoes when they sat in &quot;circle time&quot;. Decorated them with hats from the dress-up area. The teacher didn&#39;t tell her, &quot;No.&quot; After all, the teacher did not know how to say &quot;no&quot; to an autistic child. She could only teach non-disabled children. The poor children looked to her for guidance, and she instructed them to ignore her. So they did. It was hard, when she was actually touching their feet and faces, but they managed. Such was the trust this teacher inspired in her charges.

I spoke to her about Laurel being frustrated because she could not communicate. I asked about the computer in the classroom. I told her Laurel could at least point and click to an activity they were doing or to a color she wanted. She told me, with evident pride, that Laurel was treated just like every other child; she was not allowed any more computer time than anyone else. I stopped short of asking her how much time each child got in a wheel chair, if one child needed that equipment.

The teacher complained about Laurel&#39;s disruptive presence to the principal. The principal spoke to the district special services coordinator, and the special services coordinator engaged an expensive behavioral consultation firm to observe Laurel&#39;s program and recommend a plan of action. The consultants came and took their notes. They wrote up a report recommending that Laurel remain in the classroom, since that was the only environment in which she could learn the skills for success in the classroom. 

The district rejected this recommendation. They suggested instead that Laurel be moved to a self-contained classroom where two staff people would be assigned to her and only her at all times, and would work intensively on teaching her the skills she would need for &quot;secondary inclusion.&quot;  This appears to be a hot buzz-word for &#39;&#39;&quot;you can have your rights... later.&quot;&#39;&#39;

I am trying to remember why I agreed to this. Most people &#39;&#39;in the community*&#39;&#39; would not.

Bruno&#39;s work, along with others at the time, gave people an easy out: fix the mother, and you will fix the child.  Naturally, this involves expensive psychotherapy for both the mother and child. With a preverbal, nonresponsive child, and a mother who wants her child to improve (minimum goals, like stop the round the clock screaming, eat, use the toilet), this can take time. 

&#39;&#39;Mothers are cold and remote&#39;&#39;; children are spoiled. Mothers are nonresponsive; children shut out the world with self-stimulation or blank, unresponsive staring.

The more painful the psychotherapy, the more we know it works. The more marriages suffer, children suffer, the better--we are getting to the heart of the matter.

It took a long time to disprove this without a doubt.

These are a layman&#39;s notes, so perhaps it is all wrong. I certainly am not going to give this in a conference or to the AMA, so it is not vetted. But so what? I can deconstruct &#39;&#39;Bruno&#39;&#39; pretty easily. Much more easily than I can construct him.

First off, why does he assume that these illnesses are caused by an emotive disorder? This is akin to assuming that quadruplegics or Down&#39;s syndrome or any number of ailments are caused by our emotions. And while I know some people think they are, I think we have enough evidence that if you treat the physical body you can cure or prevent the physical ailments (look at polio, smallpox, etc.)

Second, why is it the mother&#39;s fault? What happened to the other members of the family who were in the same environment and who did not develop autism? 

Third, why draw the parallel between the averted gaze of an autistic child and the averted gaze of a concentration camp prisoner? Or a parallel between &quot;&#39;&#39;the disregard of reality&#39;&#39; and the withdrawal into fantasy life&quot; (&#39;&#39;page 67*&#39;&#39;). This is obviously a personal inference: Bruno saw both, and therefore both were related.  The idea that autistic children see too much of the world that sounds, sights, taste, smell are too overwhelming as their organs are too highly developed is just as valid (and this is corroborated by accounts from &quot;high functioning&quot; autistic people). 

Of course, beating up on Bruno is easy to do. We all do it. We have to to &#39;&#39;keep our sanity&#39;&#39;.

She knew better--she had drawn the same picture repeatedly. For her the picture showed her trap, the black distance between her world and the real world. The hole was herself and the black space the &#39;&#39;impossible distance&#39;&#39; between her understanding and the world&#39;s expectations (page 101).

Bruno Bettleheim&#39;s work stems from his survival in the German concentration camps. He admits this: &quot;Through (Anna, a patient), the phenomenon of the camps which had long occupied much of my personal and theoretical interest became somehow linked with my daily work, the treatment of severly disturbed children.&quot; (&#39;&#39;page 7*&#39;&#39;)

He is concerned with the loss of humanity that he sees around him--first in the camps, then in the eyes of the lost children (those he &#39;&#39;pins a label on&#39;&#39;--infantile autism). Naturally, the causes of absence are the same. The souls who fled before their bodies died in camps were fleeing the horrors of men who could kill. Men to whom caring and love were words they had no time to remember, and to whom other human beings could be vermin to be extinguished. 

Bruno could not find the souls within the autistic children he treated. So he deduced that these souls, too had fled. And whose inhumanity could these innocents have feared? Only that presented at the mother&#39;s breast. &#39;&#39;So he knows*&#39;&#39; that the children&#39;s drawings represent the bizarre inhumanity of a mother&#39;s missing breast (&#39;&#39;Figure 8, page 150*&#39;&#39;).  So he knows that the only way to treat these children is to take them from the &#39;&#39;obviously demented mothers&#39;&#39;. So he knows that he can save the children lost in this safe prosperity as he could not save those lost in the camps. 

Thus the &#39;&#39;SS&#39;&#39; strikes again.

I need to get a book, Harding, M.E., 1971. Woman&#39;s Mysteries. Putnam, NY.  

I&#39;ve been reading &quot;The Riddle of Autism&quot;. In this introduction, he explains the emotional logic behind blaming the mother for autistic child. He carefully tracks the ancient &#39;&#39;myths of mothers&#39;&#39; destroying their children to the medieval scourge of witches and misogyny to the present day Freudian based psychology that lays the blame for the child at the mother&#39;s breast.

 He says: &quot;If traits incorrectly attributed to autistic children are derived from herioc myths, the same may be true of traits attributed to their mothers...According to Harding, these mothers were the moon goddesses of various cultures, and the sons whom they destroyed were their favorite children.&quot;

I want to believe that this is all nonsense. I want my neon lights, my television and computer screens to illuminate the dark corners of the past and tell me it is all some misguided superstition.  Yet I know there is some truth that has survived the interminable passage of generations. Somehow, I know that the &#39;&#39;moon mother&#39;&#39; still lives after all these millenia. Her hatred or her desperation (I am not sure which) still forces us to devour our children. It is this trait, long suppressed by the science of Freudian analysis and encephalograms that comes to the fore when we least expect it. I must be on guard. I must get this book.

Remind me to do this.

You guys are gonna love this one. I got a call from Ivan Newchurch, the new psychiatrist the school assigned to Laurel. He doesn&#39;t want to see her, doesn&#39;t want to know her background or her signals. 

He thinks &#39;&#39;Buspar*&#39;&#39; is the answer and then told me I wasn&#39;t serious about helping Laurel when I wondered about the target symptoms and interactive side effects.  I quoted the Autism Research Institute&#39;s summary of parent ratings of behavioral effects of drugs and nutrients, which showed 27 percent of those on Buspar were rated worse for behavior. I suggested Nystatin instead, a 4 percent rating of worse.

He looked out the window while I fumbled through my papers. The window didn&#39;t enthrall him as much as his pencil did, as he twirled it through his fingers and asked &#39;&#39;where Laurel&#39;s father was&#39;&#39;. 

Out to lunch is what I wanted to tell him. Just the same as you are now. There are some moments though, that I do manage to hold onto my shreds of sanity, and for which I am duly grateful.

&quot;What difference does it make now?&quot; I asked him. My voice was modulated, radiating righteous indignation at the question, but playing the game so he couldn&#39;t call me a non team player.

&quot;No,&quot; he said. The pencil found its way back to the desk as he leaned toward me. &quot;Seriously. Where is the father?&quot; 

&quot;We separated about six years ago. He is now happily married, a stay-at-home father with two kids. His wife sends me child support payments every other week. Both of the kids speak English,&quot; I told him. &quot;&#39;&#39;No one is from the moon&#39;&#39; in his new family.&quot; I leaned back in my chair and crossed my legs. No signals here, pal.

&quot;And you seem to resent this,&quot; he said. 

&quot;No,&quot; I told him. &quot;This is what you seem to want to hear.&quot;

Then he prescribed some Buspar for me, too.

Ever notice how people will invariably ask for things they don&#39;t really mean? The other day, Dr. Joseph Elnor (the tenth or twelfth in a long line of people called in by social services) examined Laurel. There were &#39;&#39;bruises&#39;&#39; on Laurel&#39;s arms and back, and Social Services thought it was probably Mom who caused them. I told them that I most certainly had not bruised my daughter, but they were welcome to examine her. Which they did.

The guy was actually pretty sympathetic, joking about how we&#39;d come a long way from the 50&#39;s diagnoses of cold mothers. He didn&#39;t subscribe to &#39;&#39;Bruno Betleheim&#39;&#39;&#39;s theories, he said, although they were still taught in the med schools as best practice. &quot;But we all know better now,&quot; he said. And patted my knee.

It only took about three interns to hold Laurel down while he looked at her.  The interns wore gloves, and you could see the latex marks like a blue delft china pattern on her pale skin when they finished.

When Dr. Elnor took his gloves off from the inside out and washed his hands thoroughly in the metal sink, he turned his face to the wall and said I needed to do a much better job of supervision. Laurel&#39;s bruises were pretty much self-explanatory, (in fact, he couldn&#39;t tell what were original bruises and what were added from the examination) but these little accidents were simply too much. 

Obviously, letting a kid in a cast &#39;&#39;climb back up on the roof&#39;&#39; was bordering on negligence and quite possibly abuse. But given the circumstances, he really didn&#39;t think it would be a good idea to report my case to Social Services as neglect. Was there anything he could do to help?

I asked &quot;Do you know a good babysitter?&quot;

He walked out.

Actually, I was pretty lucky , getting Dr. Elnor. Thanks to Colorado&#39;s code requiring mandatory reporting of child abuse, he had to take some pains to explain that it was not child abuse, and that I was an ok mother. There is no room for error in the system anymore. We won&#39;t have &#39;&#39;children starving in closets&#39;&#39; in the good old US of A, no sireebob.

I feel so Machievellian at times I even frighten myself. And nothing ever frightens me. Except of course the Mafia. But then I am so briliant a strategist that I could probably think circles around them. Of course, you guys are totally lost without a clue about what I am (or am not, as the case may be) talking about. 

Babysitters, of course. You think Calvin&#39;s mother had problems?? At least her babysitter kept coming back (demanding mucho mulah in the process, but nonetheless...) I have a stopwatch to time &#39;&#39;how long my babysitters last&#39;&#39;. The shortest time is 2.8 seconds. As my favorite editor-type friend used to say, out of a &quot;slush pile&quot; of 100 babysitters, 2 or 3 are good for an afternoon read, and 1 perhaps out of a 1,000 are good for actually being able to step out of the house and read. Of course, I would have much better things to do with my spare time than read babysitters.

The Machievellian part is coming in here now, so watch out. I have started to take Janet and Laurel to the local high school hangout. These are carefully planned trips on days when Laurel is the most amiable. I wash every part of her body, comb out her butter soft blonde hair, get her into a yellow and green dress with a little Peter Pan collar on it, and we go off for a Root Beer Float with Peanut Butter. These words are usually enough to guarantee pretty good behavior - as long as the Root Beer Float lasts. &#39;&#39;Janet is such a cute little talker&#39;&#39;. She&#39;ll charm the fries off of anybody. And so she reels them in while Laurel and I sit quietly. Then while the bait is staring politely at Laurel&#39;s porcelain skin, pixie green eyes, and lithe dancing body, I pounce.

So, do any babysitting? No late nights, just a couple of Saturday afternoons so I can get some urgent errands done. Yes, as you can guess, Laurel is disabled. She&#39;s autistic. She doesn&#39;t communicate or live really on the same world we do. But I&#39;ll pay you six times the going rate. And I&#39;ll stay in the house with you the first time. What do you say?

So far, I&#39;ve gotten one kid who stayed for the entire first day. But refused to come back.

Subject: Mothering is now a crime

I am going to be calm about this. I am going to put it down from the beginning. Take a deep breath. And scream later.

I agreed to go along with the school&#39;s plans again this year to keep Laurel in an intensive private setting - with the stipulation that an aggressive plan for re-integration, with a specific time-table, be included in the IEP. She was to have recess, P.E., and lunch with other kids.

Laurel started the year in the big, sunny, special ed room. She had two staff members assigned to her at all times, so that, if she were aggressive to one, the other could move in to intervene - and also, I suspect, so that if &#39;&#39;she ever did start communicating&#39;&#39;, or if her behavior worsened or she started playing with her genitals, they&#39;d have a speaking witness to testify that their staff members never abused her. That&#39;s okay by me. I believe in the old saying that, &quot;conscience is that still, small voice that tells you someone might be watching.&quot;

I checked back periodically to see how the re-integration time-line was going. I was told things were going &quot;really well&quot;. I never saw anything in writing. I was informed that my frequent visits communicated a lack of faith in the staff. They also said that my presence was disruptive to Laurel, who had &quot;developed certain behavioral expectations&quot; in my presence. I was asked not to come by for at least a month.

I continued to volunteer my time at the school - since I couldn&#39;t look for a real job and needed to be on hand anyway. One morning, after doing a two-hour shift in the library, I decided to just peek in the door to see Laurel without her seeing me. I had brought in cookies for Janet&#39;s class, and since they were a kind &#39;&#39;Laurel could have*&#39;&#39;, I wanted to bring her one.

She didn&#39;t see me. She wasn&#39;t there. I asked where Laurel was, thinking I&#39;d be told she was in P.E.. as that was what she was scheduled for. Oh no, they told me. &quot;She&#39;s in private therapy.&quot; They needed the big room for other things, so Laurel had been moved to a &quot;private classroom.&quot; I asked to see the room. Laurel was in what had been a storage closet. Sandwiched between the inner hallway and the special ed room, the ten by six foot space had no external doors and one non-opening window, permanently covered. When I poked my head in, the only functioning door had been closed for some time. The aide had hold of Laurel&#39;s wrist, swirling her fingers in menthol shaving cream on a mirror. The smell was overpowering, with no ventilation. Laurel was completely limp and unfocused, clearly escaping &#39;&#39;the sensory assault&#39;&#39; the only way she could.

I took Laurel in my arms and carried her up to the principal&#39;s office. She was still groggy, unfocused. Waited outside his door while he met with a student. Then I barged in politely and asked for a minute of his time as it was an emergency. I said &#39;&#39;huffily*&#39;&#39;, &quot;Legally you need to give me ten days warning before substantively changing Laurel&#39;s education. Her IEP says that between two and three (it was 2:15) she will be integrating with the P.E. class. Keeping Laurel in a room without ventilation and using toxic substances looks like a substantial change to her health, let alone her education. Why isn&#39;t her IEP being followed?&quot;

Mr. Maddox replied that &quot;The school &#39;&#39;did not have enough staff&#39;&#39; to do the IEP as it was written, so we made a few minor changes.&quot;

I took a deep breath and said, &quot;I will come here and work, full time, every day, in any capacity that you need, so that you can make available the staff to do my daughter&#39;s program as it is written in her IEP.&quot; 

The principal left the office. A few minutes later, the social worker walked in. She said, &quot; I&#39;m really sorry, but I&#39;ve been told to tell you that you are being disruptive and you have to leave or &#39;&#39;you&#39;ll be arrested&#39;&#39;.&quot;

It took a while to sink in. Arrested for rescuing my daughter from noxious fumes?  Arrested for volunteering my servitude? Disruptive for offering to give up my days so that they could be in compliance with the law? 

So I left.

And I took Laurel with me.

Subject:  Which road to take? When? How?


There are so many choices offered, so many types of hope.  Every few months, the Autism Society of America&#39;s Colorado Chapter Quarterly comes out, with everything from calls for research participants for neuropsychological studies to causes (is it genetic? allergens? early antibiotics? reactions to vaccines?) to cures (&#39;&#39;drugs*&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;diets*&#39;&#39;, occupational therapy). 

Take this drug, do this aversive, try this behavior mod. The Loovatz method boasts an 80 percent rate of cure - the Loovatz method is debunked. A newspaper article shows a child &quot;reunited&quot; with his family on the xyz method - the next paper shows a child was killed at the xyz clinic and the method is shown to be ineffective.

What to do and when to do it is my main concern for Laurel. Have I completely blown her chances for communication, for an independant life because I did not go to New Orleans for the abc method? Or in not going, did I save her life? This is more than a 64,000 dollar question. This is her life. But then of course, &#39;&#39;insurancefatekarmamoon&#39;&#39; keeps conspiring against me on this one.

Let me just take one example. Auditory Integration Therapy, has a couple of offshoots, but the main idea is to strengthen the hairs in the inner ear and recharges the &quot;channel to the brain and nervous system.&quot;  It is thought that autistic children have &#39;&#39;hypersenstive hearing&#39;&#39; - a refrigerator sounds to them like standing next to an airplane ready for takeoff would sound to us. (Thought, hell. PROVEN. Laurel makes such a fuss when the air conditioning goes on in the next room that we use her reaction to determine whether or not the air conditioner is actually working.) 

So the first question is, which branch? The Tomatis method takes 75-120 hours of listening and the Berard takes 10. Each claims success, each claims different methods, each claims different theories behind the success. 

The second question is, where will the money come from? It&#39;s $100 an hour, no matter which method you take. This is of course, experimental, so my insurance won&#39;t pay for it. (Mind you, I pay about $300 a month for this insurance, as I am not currently employed with a legitimate employer to kick in any insurance benefits.)  Then we fight that battle. Well, insurance will pay for it if a psychiatrists on the preferred provider list refer Laurel to the program. So I spend three days going down the insurance provider list. This one is not doing any referring, this one is out of town, this one is retiring. I finally find a psychiatrist that does referrals, but he won&#39;t work with autism. So then I get the school to try to buy into it, but they need the scientific data, which the Auditory Integration Therapy centers aren&#39;t giving out. So I get around that, we get it into the Individualized Education Plan somehow, and then both centers close in Denver and the nearest one is in Montreal. Which the district will not stand for.

So,what to do really does become the question. I follow up one tantalizing lead (step right up ladies and gentleman, see the dead brought back to life! See the &#39;&#39;preverbal*&#39;&#39;, aggressive child take biology and calculus in high school! Witness a miracle!) only to work through the dead ends and find the choice withering away. Should I have spent that time and money chasing down a different pipe dream? Or would I be better off to do nothing at all?

This is what I do not know.

Sarah Murphy (Laurel) Diagnosis and Recommendations

I recently completed my review of the extensive records provided by the mother and school district. I have reviewed the situation with Ms. Bradshaw, Ms. Scratcherd, and Dr. Morgan.  I believe we agree that given the signs of episodic &#39;&#39;physiocological hyperarousal&#39;&#39;, and barring any cardiovascular contraindications, and in the absence of a definitive co-existing medical or psychiatric problem, a trial of Clonidine would probably be a relatively benign, conservative, and possibly effective treatment.

However, I should emphasize that we are talking in terms of estimates of relative probablities of sucess here, and that &#39;&#39;trials of several different medications&#39;&#39; may be necessary before we arrive at the most efficacious, optimal solution. What is crucial here is that (1) Each different medication is given a &quot;fair trail&quot; and (2) we are taking very good data to determine the effects of each medication. By a &quot;fair trail,&quot; I am referring to the extremely consistent administration of each medication as prescribed, at a therapeutic level (which may require several increases in dosages) for a minimum period of time as determined by Laurel&#39;s physician. We can set up an appropriate data collection system for you and the school. This is likely to be a long process involving a period of several months or years, and patience is critical. We should avoid discontinuing any medication before a fair trial is completed, except of course in cases where there are significant and unmistakable negative impacts. Even in these cases, continue the medication until Laurel&#39;s physician and I have consulted. 

Please contact me if you have any questions, and please give my regards to Mr. Morgan, the principal, who has been a &#39;&#39;pleasure to work&#39;&#39; with.


Sincerely Yours,

John Alfred, EdD.
Licensed Psychologist.

Subject: You can&#39;t get there from here, lady.


I applied for a job today. It&#39;s a $6.50 per hour, data-entry at home job. But after driving out to Westminster and taking the typing test and the IQ test and filling out the application, they gave me a list of &quot;policies&quot; that says you can&#39;t have children at home while you&#39;re working. Me, being the honest person I am, told the receptionist that my 7 and 9 year olds would be home some of the time. Me, being the simple, straightforward, and dishonest person that I am, did not explain about Laurel&#39;s handicap, the times they take her from school, or anything else about the matter. I figured the simplest explanations were all the receptionist could handle.

Apparently, she could not even handle this. Her face fell about a thousand miles and she inched back in horror that I would come looking for an at home job and actually have kids at the same time. She said that would disqualify me for the job. And pursed her lips. I told her that, if I could get child care, I wouldn&#39;t be working for $6.50 an hour. She said she&#39;d bring it up with the boss and turned back to her paperwork. I was definitely dismissed.

I&#39;ve been looking for a way to keep food on the table and electricity in the computer so I can have a lifeline to you guys and the autism list. All I saw yesterday for at-home work was the old &quot;stuff envelopes at home&quot; trick and the even older profession - &#39;&#39;phone sex*&#39;&#39;. Obviously I took advantage of neither one. We&#39;ll see. Something has to turn up - after all I can&#39;t live my whole life in a &#39;&#39;catch-22&#39;&#39;, now can I?

G&#39;night.

Subject:  Without a tree.

One of my neighbors came over today to ask me why my leaves still weren&#39;t raked. And for that matter, why I hadn&#39;t bothered to mow the lawn* all summer long. He said that my inexcusable laxness was driving down the property values for the whole neighborhood. And he didn&#39;t even want to look inside. I tried to explain that I was a single mother trying to raise two kids, and one of these kids needed 12 hour a day therapy. He said that in this day and age that was no excuse. So I thought I&#39;d let him see the world from my point of view. Only he wouldn&#39;t stay long enough to listen. So I typed out a morning for him anyway:

The dog is barfing in the kitchen because she ate some sugar Laurel sprinkled on the floor. Janet wants to find her pink and purple tee shirt and meanwhile Laurel is putting her hands through the glass windows and clutching the &#39;&#39;sharp glass edges&#39;&#39; so that there are glass shards in her hands that go nearly through to the other side. 

So you go to the emergency room. There is &#39;&#39;no one to watch&#39;&#39; Janet so off she goes with you, only you forget Smiley, her stuffed rat, and you have to drive the car, make sure Laurel doesn&#39;t faint, and explain to Janet that you simply cannot turn the car around and retrieve Smiley and Smiley will be there when you get back. Laurel is white faced, her eyes slowly widening as she says nothing but holds the hand out in front of her without waving. 

You wait in the emergency room and try to comfort Laurel who is now rocking and dripping blood over the emergency room carpet as each rocking motion drives the glass shard deeper into her hand. You try to keep your eye on Janet who is hopping up and down on one foot, trying to read &quot;Place your insurance information here&quot; and coming close to stabbing her face with a pencil she has picked up from god knows where.

When you get to see the doctor, he asks what happened. You explain that you don&#39;t really know, and are not sure how deep the glass shards go.  He puts in stitches without telling Laurel or you what is happening, and Laurel jerks her hand away. This time you ask a nurse to explains exactly what is going on and she does a great job, so you feel like a jerk for being mad at the doctor.

Then you explain to the doctor that Laurel will rip out the stitches before you get to the car. The doctor tells you as he is walking away, &quot;Well, don&#39;t let her.&quot; 

&quot;Who do you think is driving?&quot; You ask his back. He turns back to you, &quot;Can&#39;t someone else pick you up?&quot;

You rack your brain and go through your address book. Dad is out of town, the Hardys are on vacation, and that exhausts your entire repetoire of a support network. There is no one else available. In the entire Metro Denver phone book, there are &#39;&#39;no friends to call&#39;&#39;. You shake your head.

The doctor leaves.

You try to wrestle the steering wheel out of your daughter&#39;s bound hands. The wound starts to bleed again and the stitches catch on the gearshaft. 

You return to the emergency room and ask for a different doctor. And go through the whole thing again. 

Right, well, this is about as far as I can get in the scenario--not that I couldn&#39;t go on indefinitely, but Laurel just woke up and I need to make sure she doesn&#39;t try to take a shower with her bandaged hands. 

Donations to the Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered would be welcome as long as they contain a one-way ticket for me.

Subject: &#39;&#39;Flea training*&#39;&#39;

So many of you have asked why Laurel is not receiving Social Security disability payments. These would pay for some of the medical treatments, food, etc. I have tried, believe me. I will probably try again very soon. Just as quickly as we recover from &#39;&#39;the last battle&#39;&#39; with the red-tape breathing dragon.

About a year ago, I called up the local office. They set up an appointment. As it was summer vacation, had to take Janet with me. I couldn&#39;t take Laurel because I knew she&#39;d tear the place apart. So I got Chris to watch Laurel and off we went. We sat in a hallway with orange plastic chairs until forty-five minutes after our appointment time. Then the worker, Ms. A, has something to say about how she&#39;s sorry to be late; she forgot to schedule herself a lunch, so she&#39;s going to have to make all her afternoon appointments wait. 

I say, &quot;These things happen.&quot; I&#39;m sincerely ready to blow it off. 

Then she says we need to begin by going over my form S-1375/B or something. I tell her I don&#39;t have a form S-1375/B. She says, &quot;Well, you can&#39;t apply unless you have an S dash one three seven five stroke B.&quot; She stares at me accusingly for a minute. 

Trying to be helpful, I say, &quot;Could you give me a form S dash one three seven five stroke B?&quot;

She says, &quot;No. You&#39;re supposed to have it.&quot;

I say, &quot;Where was I supposed to get it?&quot;

She says, &quot;From us.&quot;

I say, &quot;I don&#39;t have it.&quot;

She says, &quot;Then you must have lost it.&quot; (Her voice is getting snippier by the minute.)

I say, &quot;I guess I must have. May I have another?&quot;

She says, &quot;No.&quot; And she leans back and just stares at me, looking smugly contemptuous, as if she has taught me a lesson for my irresponsible ways, and I won&#39;t ever take HER for granted again!

I ask to speak to her supervisor. She demands to know why. I tell her it appears we have reached an impasse. She says that we would not have if I would just give her the form. We go around a little while. Janet bursts into tears. I excuse us and go to the front desk where I demand to see the woman&#39;s supervisor. I hold Janet as she sobs on my shoulder. Janet tells me she is so afraid that the lady is going to take us away because we don&#39;t have the form. I tell her I am going to fix it. After fifteen minutes, the supervisor, Ms. B, calls us back into her office. I explain the problem about my not having and apparently having no right to obtain a form S dash one three seven five stroke B. She pulls up Laurel&#39;s case on the computer, peruses it for a moment and says, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t need that anyway.&quot;

She gives me a list of the documentation I do need, and enters the follow-up appointment herself, with a different worker, Ms. C.  The next available appointment is six weeks away. She tells me not to worry; eligibility for benefits is calculated from the date of first application, so Laurel will be receiving benefits retroactively to that date, even though we had a &quot;miscommunication&quot; about the paperwork needed.

Six weeks later, I arrive for my appointment, documentation in hand. I inform the people at the front desk that I have an appointment with Ms. C. The receptionist says actually, my appointment is with Ms. A. I say there must be some mistake. Ms. A was extremely antagonistic to me last time -- actually drove my child to tears -- and Ms. B told me I could see Ms. C. The receptionist informs me that Ms. B is no longer with the department. Moreover, all cases are assigned by the first letter of the applicant&#39;s last name. Our case belongs to Ms. A and no one else. So fine, here I am. I go see Ms. A.

Ms. A sits down at the computer and says that today will be my initial application date since it&#39;s the first time I have come into the office. I tell her it isn&#39;t; the first time was six weeks earlier. She says that can&#39;t possibly be true, because if it were, we would be in the computer. She says, &quot;There&#39;s no way for that to be erased unless somebody deliberately went in and erased it.&quot; (Smirk) 

I say, &quot;But I met with you. My daughter was with me.&quot;

She insists she has no recollection of having met before. 

I return to the front desk and ask to speak to the supervisor. I explain the situation and ask to see a different worker. She says, &quot;What would happen if everyone was allowed to choose their worker?&quot;

I respond, &quot;I guess you&#39;d find out in a hurry who&#39;s good and who&#39;s a smirking bitch.&quot;

The supervisor responded that I had the option of using the Social Security office the next county over. She added, helpfully, that they would send over my paperwork confirming that today should be preserved as the initial application date for calculating benefits. I said, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Took her name and left.

Eight weeks later, I have the earliest available appointment in the next county. The worker wants me to bring Laurel with me. She says this will circumvent a lot of the documentation. I explain that Laurel does not wait well and becomes violent. I ask for the very first appointment after her lunch break, so she should not be running late.

After a thirty minute drive, we arrive. Laurel is soooo good. I am really proud. We play games: &quot;Touch your nose.&quot; &quot;Do this.&quot; &quot;Clap your hands.&quot; &quot;Tickle, tickle, stop.&quot; After twenty-five minutes, Laurel is getting antsy. I stall for time. We walk around the building. We go to the bathroom. I take off her shoes and massage her feet. Then, a miracle! Laurel signs &quot;all done&quot;! Spontaneous communication! &#39;&#39;Such things must be honored&#39;&#39;. But no. We have been waiting forty-five minutes. The worker will call for us any moment. Well, if words don&#39;t work, Laurel knows what will. She begins rocking, humming, rubbing frantically at her nose. I try to touch her. The humming becomes a screech as she lashes out at my face. She jumps out of her seat and runs for the door and the busy parking lot. I restrain her. She screams and rocks hard into my chest. I take her down to the floor, wrapping both our arms around her. Her frantic rocking connects the back of her head to my eyebrows. I&#39;m seeing lovely, violet flowers blooming before my eyes. She bites at my hands. I am vaguely aware that everyone is staring. Light as a cat, I spring around in front of Laurel, saying and signing, &quot;All done?!&quot; 

Laurel emphatically imitates the &quot;all done&quot; sign. 

I say, &quot;OK! Good talking! Let&#39;s go!&quot; And we are out the door.

When I get home, there is a message on the machine. The worker says it was less than five minutes after I left that she came out to get us; there had been an emergency. Everyone told her what had happened. She would give us the next available appointment. And I didn&#39;t have to bring Laurel this time. By the way, she had called the other office, and they had no record of my having been in. But not to worry; she would make sure that today was preserved as my date of initial application, for calculating benefits.

I never went back. It&#39;s my fault, I suppose, for not pursuing my resources.

Ms. Peggy Somebody or Other up at &#39;&#39;Social Services&#39;&#39; called wanting to know why Laurel had not been in school from November 10 to January 19th of last year. Now I want you to note that this is an entire year later and the SS neglected to say anything about this last year when I called. Apparently, they don&#39;t have any records of my calling the Colorado Department of Education every single day of those 2 months. Even the Office of Civil Rights doesn&#39;t have records of bouncing me back and forth.

She briskly implied that this was neglect on my part and really didn&#39;t want to hang around on the phone for an answer. So I told her that I yanked Laurel when I discovered that they had her in that &#39;&#39;storage closet&#39;&#39; 6.5 hours a day, with untrained staff, doing peg boards and playing with shaving cream. 

She thought that this was a very unprofessional thing for &quot;Mom&quot; to do and that if I couldn&#39;t cooperate with the school board, they really shouldn&#39;t cooperate with me.

I asked her if she had been listening. She said she had been. Every word.

Subject: I know education is supposed to hurt, but this is ridiculous.

Hey guys, ever put your foot down only to have it go through a wall? Crazy spaceship earth where anything can happen. And it usually does. I think I need a ticket off this planet. And yet where would I go? Ahh, the typical vacationer&#39;s dilemma. So happy am I that something in my life is typical.

Anyway, anyway, anyway. 

Laurel is having her &quot;little Christmas frenzies,&quot; as Mr. Maddox so quaintly put it, so we agreed to try a day program. I had to say ok, because they weren&#39;t giving me any other choice. So agree I guess I did. This is what it says on the papers. Consent given. 

After only four weeks on inaction (such speedy gonzales they said they were for me, most people take eight to twelve weeks for &#39;&#39;emergency placement*&#39;&#39;.) It is a lady willing to babysit/teach and her daughter. Which is cool - I mean I&#39;m all for free enterprise. Just look at how I get &#39;&#39;babysitters&#39;&#39;.

So the lady comes up to the door, reeking of cigarette smoke. (Have I mentioned before that whenever Laurel is exposed to cigarette smoke, she develops large hives and starts coughing? The coughs usually end up long and deep, keeping us all up nights for weeks on end.) And it is too late now to do anything, the school says we have to do this for a minimum trial period. (A stray thought wandered into my mind: Wonder if they would force other kids to endure a classroom on top of a powerplant stack for a minimum trial period. . .but I banish this wispy thought immediately as unworthy.) I ask her if she smokes in the house. She says &quot;Yeah, gotta problem with that?&quot; &#39;&#39;I can say nothing --&#39;&#39; I am so mad. So she assumes I don&#39;t and leaves. Laurel&#39;s green and yellow ruffles droop slowly as she walks behind the lady.

She brings Laurel back, and I can see the rash starting on Laurel&#39;s chin and down under the neckline of her dress. She says &quot;The cutest thing happened. My daughter had a candy cigarette and said she was going to chill out with a smoke and gave your daughter one too. Your daughter held it just right.&quot; And the lady smiled and left. 

I called the school and said no more, no more. They said I was refusing recommended treatment and would not pay for anything else. Laurel is coughing now, and bringing up great hunks of blood. Already.

Next year had better be better.

Congratulations. You win. I&#39;ve had &#39;&#39;all the red tape&#39;&#39;, the bloodied bits of papers and forms I can take. 

I now ask only that I be allowed to sacrifice my golden girl, my strong silent daughter to your highest altar. After all, this is what you have wanted all along.

Like Hecate&#39;s night hawks, you swoop down and cast her &#39;&#39;into your tempest&#39;&#39;. I know she will never escape from your whirlwind of phone calls which end only in empty shadows beyond the moon.

Would you ever be as kind as Artemis, who at least took her sacrifice, Iphegenia, away from the cruel brothers and gave her a hundred palaces in the moon? 

No. I thought not.

Subject:   What to do what to do what to do

I guess I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying here. I know &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t have answers&#39;&#39;, but I don&#39;t have any questions either. I&#39;m sure I should. 

What really blew my mind was catching myself in the act of discussing straight-jackets, &#39;&#39;cuffs&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;time out closets&#39;&#39; for my daughter. I was so calm, it worries me. Shouldn&#39;t I be upset? Shouldn&#39;t I be demanding that they provide more or better services and make some progress? I really do believe that they are doing everything I could wish. 

These people are committed to Laurel in a way that puts my mothering in a bad light. They -love- her. And I do not use that word lightly. They are more knowledgable, patient and compassionate than I am - or if not, they have the added discipline of team support and limited contact. They are doing everything I could suggest and more.

Ms. Bradshaw, the district coordinator of special education, mentioned a few times that Laurel&#39;s program is costing in excess of $60,000 a year, and that &#39;&#39;we can&#39;t continue&#39;&#39; this arrangement indefinitely. Creating an environment in which Laurel would be at ease is not part of the consideration. Yet they really did do some contortions to work this out, and I may be able to get something similar for next year, but after that,  there are no programs like this available. We really must move toward less or more restrictive in the near future.

I should mention that I believe absolutely that the program they have for Laurel is the best possible; she loves to go to school. Sometimes she dresses and goes on Saturdays, or she leaves the house in the morning before I&#39;m ready. The academic work is appropriate and interesting and constantly reviewed and updated. They do a lot of sensory stuff, like swinging, swimming, gymnastics, pressure stuff to stimulate nerves and calm senses. They analyze each episode of aggression and try to teach Laurel alternative, functional methods of communicating her needs. 

None of us can find anything in the program to improve.  But we don&#39;t know what will happen in the future.

The school suggested more medication and a tighter regime for checking the results of the current medication. I had already decided to try this, and I have been getting the insurance and information release paperwork in to a psychiatrist I&#39;m &#39;&#39;not entirely comfortable with&#39;&#39;, but who will probably be adequate in his limited role. He knows pharmaceutical interventions, and he&#39;s conservative.

He knows nothing about other forms of intervention. Even so, the first med may not be the right one, and it could take three weeks or more to even know what effect the first thing we try will have. So that&#39;s a yes, but not fast enough, and the results are not guaranteed.

So, looks like we&#39;ll be having &#39;&#39;enzyme and protease cocktail&#39;&#39; soup for lunch for a while. Anyone care to join us?

Subject:   Behaviorial conditioning in action.

The school feels that safety should be the number one priority.  How could I argue with that?  So the school staff wrote into the behavior program that, if Laurel was aggressive three times in one day, the school would call me and I would have to come pick her up.  The consultants objected:  Laurel would learn to hit to communicate that she wanted to go home.  I objected:  this functionally prevented me from being &#39;&#39;able to work&#39;&#39;, since I had to be on call every moment of every day.  And besides, since when was going home with Mom a punishment?  The school staff helpfully suggested that, when I came to take her home, I should make sure the day was not pleasant, so that she would not wish to come home in the future.

Last Monday, I got a call at 3p.m  telling me that Laurel was having a very difficult morning and I must come get her right away.  Tuesday, I  got a call at 10 am.  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, I got a call at 9:20 am.  Why the precise time?  This is five minutes after the new behavioral specialist (whom Laurel likes a great deal) leaves.  Dr. Joseph Alfred, EdD. a behavioral specialist the district just employed as a new consultant,  now comes to work with Laurel and teach her staff strategies from 8:30 to 9:15 a.m.  When I returned home from getting Laurel, who was &#39;&#39;just too agressive&#39;&#39; to be at school safely, there would be a message on my phone from Dr. Alfred telling me what a great day Laurel was having, what a delightful mood she was in.

Is it just my imagination, or is Laurel a fast learner?

The school finally came around!  GOOD NEWS! Yes, sending Laurel home after she hits three times simply means that Laurel will hit three times and expect to go home.  So they decided to keep her in school when she is agressive.  Safety is still the number one concern, so how do we ensure that the teachers are safe?  

Carrie objected to wearing protective gear (my idea) for reasons I don&#39;t understand. She said it was like sending teachers to karate class to learn to defend themselves. 

My thought was, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; Do what you need to do to help the child. In fact, the district ought to sponsor karate classes where teachers could learn how to subdue kids without hurting them. Now, the teachers are forced to rely on their instincts, which probably do more harm than good in most cases. I tried to explain this, but the staff was so aghast at the idea that they turned their ears inside out. &#39;&#39;And would not listen&#39;&#39;.

Subject:  A peaceful intervention
Date:   1/12/97 12:23

Carrie and Marilyn have been working with peaceful interventions (when Laurel is actually there).  Dr. Alfred, the behavoir specialist, provided  two bean bag chairs and a blanket, and Laurel sits in one and they cover her with the other and lie on it, forming a Laurel sandwich.  They are teaching her to request this by moving her hands together over a pencil. Marilyn often massages her hands while she leans on the top bean bag. They always stop when she &quot;tells&quot; them to.

This corresponds to occupational therapy or sensory integration.  It seems to soothe her and they don&#39;t have any violent episodes after the sandwich treatment.

Most mothers talk about which brand of peanut butter smooths on better. I talk about Temple Grandin&#39;s squeeze machine that does the same thing but would cost about $800 if you make it yourself or $4000. Or intelliTools&#39; catalogue of keyboards and software and adaptive stuff for customized communication boards. Which is why I don&#39;t star in all that many commercials.

Then we get into southpaw occupational therapy, wieghted belts, shoes, blankets, swings, etc....

I&#39;m thinking of starting a list.

You know &#39;&#39;you are a special parent&#39;&#39; when:  

¤ Your kids don&#39;t have toys - they have therapy equipment

¤ You think koosh balls build fine motor skills

¤ Your kid &#39;&#39;falls off the roof&#39;&#39; and all you can say is &quot;We need to emphasize upper body gross motor skills for a while&quot;

¤ You don&#39;t have &#39;&#39;a living room and a family room&#39;&#39; - you have a gross motor area and fine motor area.

What the school does have right now is a storage closet in the room that could be cleared out and altered to be a &quot;time out room.&quot; Carrie hemmed and hawwed about it. She said she had resolved years ago never to use a time out room again. 

We talked about it being used just to keep them safe, and it being not a punishment, but a place where Laurel could be kept safe while she calms down. She likes to be alone, and she usually recovers from upset best that way. Carrie rolled her eyes and said, sarcastically, &quot;Great. We&#39;ll paint balloons and &#39;&#39;stick CDs&#39;&#39; on the walls . . .&quot; Ms. Bradshaw, the district special ed coordinator said, &quot;We&#39;ll call it Laurel&#39;s safe place.&quot; Carrie said, &quot;Dress it up and call it anything you want. It&#39;s still a time-out room. But I can&#39;t see any better alternative.&quot;

The vice-principal and the district head said they&#39;d take care of it between them; there are requirements in the district, such as that the door must have a window or peep hole. I insisted that it have &#39;&#39;adequate ventilation&#39;&#39;.  They also said they&#39;d need paperwork getting my OK, and that I could stipulate that only Carrie and Marilyn are allowed to put Laurel in there. (And Laurel, I suppose.) So that a sub or other staff would be unable to use it.

This makes sense to me. Of course, there aren&#39;t any subs for Laurel. If Carrie or Marilyn are ill and can&#39;t come to school, the school simply calls me and tells me to pick up Laurel. This happens about once a week or so right now, so I still can&#39;t actually get a steady job or earn money where people expect me to show up. Ah well. Such is the life of an isolated mother and child. In the big city.

&#39;&#39;I wish I lived in a horror film&#39;&#39;; it would be so much more believable than my real life.  But I swear this is true, just the way it happened.

Apparently, one of the kids who rides the handicapped bus with Laurel had been out for over a month.  Medically fragile, you know.

Yesterday, this kid&#39;s mom pushes his chair out to the curb.  The aide fetches up the lift and straps the chair in place.  Along they jounce with their load of disabled kids.  I can see Laurel stroking her face, rocking back and forth and staring at the kid.  She was sitting right across from him, they tell me.

Why do they tell me these trivial details, I hear you ask yourselves.  Because when the bus got to the school, there was this big uproar.  It seems the kid in the chair was dead.  Somebody asked the aide if the kid was dead when he got on the bus and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.  &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not part of my job&#39;&#39;.&quot;

Laurel is already in a room with her two teachers and no other students. But she still goes after them so fiercely that they are not safe. Today Laurel was attacking her teachers and they left the room, one holding each of the two doors. She opened a window, went outside and came &#39;round, laughing. 

Isolating Laurel further would involve identifying another room, another school, an institution or other place without windows, where she could be kept away from people she might hurt, and she wouldn&#39;t be able to get out.
 
Her teachers object to the idea of moving her. They say they are already in as safe an environment as they could be in given the circumstances. And more time out rooms or windowless prisons would not help matters.

For once, I agree with them. Which still doesn&#39;t leave &#39;&#39;open many options&#39;&#39;.

The moon kept trying every trick she knew - or didn&#39;t know - to put the words back into life. Failing that, she tried to take the substance from the words and give it to the shadowy things that still miserably existed, dragging their shells, looking for the &#39;&#39;missing wholes&#39;&#39;.

Nothing worked. Soon the very words of her blood and pages of her skin were in danger of disintegrating from her spells. 

The people kept coming to her, begging her to restore whatever it was they had lost. Or to tell them again what they had lost so that they could begin long, arduous quests for it themselves.

Until finally, she had had enough. The moon exploded into two:   a brighter version of herself (which stole the light from a &#39;&#39;hundred sacrificed*&#39;&#39; stars) and a paler shadow to catch the leftover brilliance.

&quot;This is what you meant,&quot; she cried out to her people. &quot;You missed the light. That is all. Now go and live in peace. Forget what you do not have. Concentrate on what is there ~ for those are the only things that exist now.&quot;

But the moon knew this was not so.

Carrie won&#39;t be back for quite some time. The jaw has to heal and probably &#39;&#39;some other stuff&#39;&#39;, too. Marilyn&#39;s explanation yesterday was:   Laurel was upset about not getting her way somehow and was pounding on Marilyn. Carrie came up behind Laurel and Laurel rocked her head back into Carrie&#39;s face. That explains Marilyn&#39;s voice on the phone; she was feeling partly responsible for Carrie getting hurt. Or it&#39;s possible that she was downplaying the incident.  I dunno. How do you downplay an attack that leads to a broken jaw?  

So we&#39;ll see. I&#39;m headed up to the hospital now. I don&#39;t know how I will explain why I haven&#39;t been there already - break down and tell &#39;&#39;the truth*&#39;&#39;, I guess. I couldn&#39;t find anyone to stay with Laurel.  After we got back from the school, Laurel started to walk back out to the school. She must have needed to finish something--or we went out the wrong door and she needed to reverse the circuit. 

But I knew the dire consequences if she were to go back.  Riots would break out in all of the peaceful, tree lined and kentucky-blue-grassed yards.  People would overturn and burn BMWs, Hondas, Geo Metros, anything just to get away from her.  The universe would wrench open and fall apart.

So I used every ounce of strength I had to wrestle her into her room.  On the way (which took about a half an hour subjective time and an eon in heroic time), she managed to gouge my cheek (which is still bleeding), pull out more of my hair, and blackened my  and burnother eye (the good one).

How&#39;s everybody out there in reality land?

Marilyn called me this morning, early. About 6. She said not to bother calling the school. Laurel was suspended for yesterday. 

I said, &quot;She can&#39;t be suspended for anything disability related.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Marilyn. &quot;Only this wasn&#39;t disability related. It had to do with the teacher&#39;s safety.&quot;

And there was &#39;&#39;nothing I could&#39;&#39; say to argue with that.

Many of you asked: Is there &#39;&#39;anything I need&#39;&#39; from you guys while I battle this out? 

War gear might come in handy. Anybody got a spare samurai suit? I dunno. I have some alarms I need to get up on doors, and I want to replace the broken front door lock. I&#39;m calling all over trying to find a pshrink we can work with.

Obviously, I&#39;m going to take the next opportunity I have to check in with some clerical contracting agencies to find some kind of type-at-home kind of work, so I won&#39;t be financially ruined if this doesn&#39;t all clear up soon.

I&#39;m not sure what I need. It&#39;s so bloody complex right now I feel all tangled up. Perhaps I&#39;ll make &#39;&#39;a list&#39;&#39;.

find a decent cd player 
find someone to watch Laurel so we can &#39;&#39;get some food&#39;&#39; in here
get a girl scout uniform for Janet
figure out why the cars brakes still squeal

go downtown, buy a lacy bustiere, &#39;&#39;go out on Colfax*&#39;&#39; and hook in some decent dough and fly off to Bangkok, make some foreign films and drink up all the money in little umbrella-covered coconuts.

The box holding the moon&#39;s words would not rest quietly at the bottom of the sea. 

The waves jiggled it. The dark fish who had never seen the moon&#39;s light nuzzled it. The words themselves pounded from the inside of the box, demanding their freedom, demanding their power.

The box rose to the surface of the sea, where mermaids picked it up and put it on their rocks, singing to the milky colors of its moonstone covering. Seamen saw it from afar and thought it was really the moon caught under the waves. Some tried to rescue it, others to steal the pearl-hued beauty. Many drowned.

The moon saw that the earth was no longer a hospitable place for her lost bounty. On a brilliant night, she daubed herself with her own blood and came down to save her box. The mermaids cried and pleaded with her to let them keep the &#39;&#39;pretty treasure&#39;&#39;. The moon refused to listen.

She tried to take it back into herself and hide it there. But her skin rejected it, cowering away from what had once been part of it and was now quite dead. She tried to hide it in the stars, but the stars merely gathered about it in wonder and refused to shine. 

She attempted many things she would not admit to herself later.

Janet&#39;s first line of defense is a great offense.

Just the other day, Janet got into a fist fight at the water fountain. Seems some girl with long hair asked some boy to hold her hair while she took a drink. Janet, with her short shoulder-length tresses, tried the same thing and promptly punched the guy who laughed at her.  Cost? Three hours in the principal&#39;s office with a crayon and coloring book on &#39;&#39;mediation techniques&#39;&#39;.

Last month, at a birthday party, all the kids were playing croquet. She says that a boy asked her to do something nasty and so she very gently tapped him with the mallet to tell him to stay out of her way. The mother says that Janet actually picked up a croquet mallet and konked him on the head. The boy required three stitches. Cost? No allowance for three months to pay for the copayment insurance and no tv for a month. 

In January, Janet kicked a girl in the face because she wasn&#39;t invited into their game of foursquare. And I could go on with this list. And on.

But I only have one question: why is Janet allowed back in school after her many violent outbursts and Laurel isn&#39;t? Is it the degree of violence? Is violence towards kids any better than violence towards adults? Or is it that Janet can &#39;&#39;talk her way out&#39;&#39; of it?

If you have been a member of the Cattail Elementary School community for several years, you may remember seeing a sun-haired girl in bright yellows and green, with a hypnotic smile tossing handfuls of sand in the air at the playground, or running in circles on the grass. 

Laurel Murphy is nine years old now, living just southeast of Denver. Her family has not participated in community activities recently because of the constraints of Laurel&#39;s disability.

Laurel is autistic.

Because of her &#39;&#39;autism*&#39;&#39;, and in direct violation of state and federal law, Laurel has been kept out of school for the past twelve weeks. The district officials say they have &#39;&#39;no qualified staff&#39;&#39;. Laurel&#39;s mother has been forced to leave her job as pre-school teacher at the First Unitarian Church in Denver to take care of Laurel.

What is autism?
 
 Imagine your brain is a stereo system with the controls messed up. Sometimes you can&#39;t even hear someone speaking directly to you - other times the voice sounds like a freight train rushing at your face. You can&#39;t think straight because of the buzz of a flourescent light that no one else seems to notice. You may not be able to tell where your legs are unless you&#39;re looking at them, but a light touch can be painful. The &#39;&#39;chaos of colors and shapes&#39;&#39; may be overwhelming so that you have to screen out everything your eyes tell you.

Sometimes you hear colors, or see sounds. All the senses work, but in mixed up ways. The world is unpredictable. And scary. You know you are afraid or hurt, but your uncontrolled brain makes you laugh. Changing your ideas to sounds, and making your mouth make those sounds is so complex, people rarely wait long enough. If they do, they probably won&#39;t understand the rough sounds you shape. And then they believe you can&#39;t think, because you can&#39;t speak.

What causes autism?

No medical test exists to diagnose autism. Autism is a list of behaviors. Those behaviors can be caused by different things; brain damage because of an injury or virus, genetic abnormalities, metabolic or environmental problems, many things we have not yet identified. Different sub-sets or severities of behaviors have different names:   Tourette&#39;s, Rhett&#39;s, Landau- Kleffner, Asperger&#39;s and Angelmen&#39;s syndromes, &quot;Happy-Puppet&quot; disease, Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).  The same child will probably be given different diagnoses by different doctors. Children with autism often develop normally for the first one to three years, and then skills mysteriously fade out as the child becomes more withdrawn.

Diagnostic criteria include: unusual physical attractiveness; lack of speech, or unusual speech, such as echoing another person&#39;s words (&#39;&#39;echolalia*&#39;&#39;) or using &quot;stock phrases,&quot; like advertising jingles (idioglossia); lack of eye contact; self-stimulatory behavior such as spinning, hand flapping or rocking; &#39;&#39;rituals&#39;&#39; or compulsions, such as needing to retrace one&#39;s steps exactly or open and close doors a certain way. People with autism often have an above-average ability to do jigsaw puzzles or memorize things by rote.

A half century ago, doctors thought autism was caused by the mother unconsciously rejecting the child. This was later rebuked as &quot;&#39;&#39;the worst idea science ever had&#39;&#39;.&quot; It seems that people with autism are unable to respond to love and other stimulation the way a neurologically typical person would.

Science is beginning to recognize what some of us have always known: there is no separation between the body and the mind. A thought or emotion is an electro-chemical event. That&#39;s why drugs can be used to treat emotional trauma, grief and depression, and why love and trust can cure physical dis-ease.

Who gets autism?

Autism is diagnosed four times more often in boys than in girls, but some of this may be because being shy and quiet is not considered a cause for concern in girls.

In the 1960s, autism was found in about four out of 10,00 births. In the 1980s, autism was diagnosed in 35 to 70 out of 10,000. Part of the reason for the increase is a changing definition of autism, and better diagnosis. But specialists who have been practicing for decades say they are definitely seeing a lot more autism, and a lot more severe autism, in recent years.

Autism may be more common in families with higher IQs and more education, or it may be that better educated parents get the autism diagnosisinstead of &quot;mental retardation&quot; or &quot;emotionally disturbed.&quot; Family histories are often significant for manic-depressive illness or obsessive-compulsive disorders, such as bulimia. A disproportional number of parents are involved in music, science, and computers.
 
&#39;&#39;How can I help&#39;&#39;?

First of all, be aware. Remember that a child bursting out through the exit door or snatching fries off your plate in a restaurant may not be able to help it.

An adult may be working so hard at turning thoughts to words that she doesn&#39;t realize she is yelling. The mother with the pinched face and cross voice may be having a week you couldn&#39;t imagine. Work on your own application of love and trust. It makes a big difference.

Second, be part of your community. Is there someone who hasn&#39;t been around as much lately? Offer to watch a dependent child or elderly parent and let that other person go shopping, or go to church, or retreat to his or her room with a book, or go on a date with his or her life-mate. &#39;&#39;Too many marriages die of exhaustion&#39;&#39;. Fatigue makes people weak and fearful. Those who need a support network the most are the ones most likely to find themselves isolated.

Third, consider a career working with the disabled. There is a critical shortage of qualified
people to work with people with disabilities, and the percentages affected with disability are rising.

Finally, there&#39;s money. Laurel&#39;s mother is a single mother - the only source of income now for the family is a small SSI payment and some child support for Laurel&#39;s needs. Auditory training, Irlen lenses, nutritional supplements, other therapies and therapists and lawyers all cost money - far more than the SSI payment covers.

Laurel&#39;s friends have established a therapy fund for her at Union Bank and Trust. Contribute today at this fundraiser, or send a contribution to the Laurel Murphy therapy fund.

Well, this holiday season, not one, not two, but five Girl Scout troops banded together to help good old Girl Scout Troop 001 (aka Laurel).  They all came over to Laurel&#39;s classroom to see her and sing carols with her.  Laurel promptly fled into the closet and refused to come out.  (I had to stay at the school until about 8 that night before we could get Laurel to budge).

They wanted to bake cookies for Laurel, but I explained that Laurel was on a special diet - due to the various allergies and medications, etc.  So that was out.  

Then Karen, Suzie&#39;s mom, got a great idea.  Now they are going to hold bake sales so that Laurel can afford the auditory integration therapy I wanted for her - at $50 a session, 2 sessions a day for 10 days - or a grand unreachable total of  $1,000.  Somehow,  I didn&#39;t get around to telling them there was no way they could earn enough money for the whole treatment - and I don&#39;t know anywhere where I can get the rest.  But we&#39;ll put it in a trust fund or something to see what we can get.  A little start is much better than no start at all, as Karen is continually saying.

So Karen and I wrote a &#39;&#39;flyer to introduce Laurel&#39;&#39; and all of the circumstances. Kim&#39;s father runs Coyote printing and printed up 3,000 copies for free.   Jessica&#39;s mother is the vice-president of Colorado National Trust Bank and set up an account for the money.  Juliette&#39;s mother runs the Ladies Christian Aid Society out of Most Precious Blood and she got all of the ladies to do a corresponding bake and craft sale at the church. So it really became a muli-family affair.  Each troop made christmas tree ornaments and yarn dolls and Melody&#39;s grandmother tried to teach the kids how to tat white thread snowflakes, but these didn&#39;t come out so well.  Then each girl baked something (we had more Rice Krispie Treats than we knew what to do with).  So we had lots of crafts and baked goods.  

The kids set up all over the neighborhood - in the school during lunch, inside Safeway (once the manager heard who this was for, he even set up chairs and tables for the kids), at the school Christmas play, in the high school, and some enterprising ones went door to door.

Upshot of the whole affair?  A net profit of $467.19!  My eyes bugged out when Jessica&#39;s mom showed me the bank balance.  I still don&#39;t know her name.  This was incredible.

But you know, it was more than the money.  The principle of this thing will keep me &#39;&#39;high for months!&#39;&#39;

Subject:  Goth night at the Rising Phoenix
Date:   2/8/95

Janet was dragging her feet at a clothing store about a month ago, using sneaky tactics to get me to break down and buy her a new outfit.  (It worked.)  I got into a conversation with the salesgirl, Judy.  She was a redhead, strong-willed, 17-year-old.   A high honors student in her senior year of high school, planning on studying psychology.  We hit it off. She gave me her number and I called her &#39;&#39;to babysit&#39;&#39;. 

She can&#39;t babysit too much, what with two jobs, school, and college applications.  But she is coming over every Thursday  and calling it a student practicum.  Her high school psychology teacher is giving some extra credit for itÑso it is a godsend for both of us.  She invited me down to a metaphyiscal bookstore/ coffee shop that has a &quot;goth night&quot; every FridayÑand even got two of her friends to sit with Janet and Laurel for that night.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect.  Various people I asked described goth (related but not identical to &quot;gothic&quot;) as &quot;where punk rock went&quot;, &quot;the dark side of hippie culture&quot;, and &quot;a vampire cult.&quot;   The most agreement I heard was on appearance:  they wear black; black clothes, black eyeliner, black lipstick (boys and girls).  Some dye their hair black. They&#39;re very pale.  They dress in lace, vinyl and leather.  Some wear chains and spikes.  The clothing is vaguely (or not so vaguely) suggestive of S&amp;M.  They girls dress slutty (Judy&#39;s word); tiny dresses, lace teddies or transparent lace blouses, short skirts, very revealing pants.  Body piercing and tattoos are common.

I was more than a little nervous.

I was a little surprised to arrive at a simple, nondescript storefront in an outdoor mall.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and the parking lot was well-lit.

It did look a little like a Halloween costume party.  A couple of the boys were wearing black skirts with pointy-toed black boots.  One had a &quot;mad hatter&quot;, flared black top hat.  Most had black lipstick and eyeliner, and some had elaborate designs painted around their eyes in black, or black and red. One had a sticker that said &quot;I&#39;m so goth I&#39;m DEAD&quot;.

The music was very loud at the front of the store, near the small, dimly-lit dance floor.  But the back was light and quiet enough to talk easily.  The coffee bar served coffees and teas and juice.  No one appeared to me to be stoned or drinking, although one boy was quite open about having &quot;done something&quot; the night before and still being a bit &quot;out of it&quot;, and most people smoked.  There was some conversation about drugs, but I got the feeling drugs were something one did when one didn&#39;t have anything else to do.  Goth Night at the Rising Phoenix was &#39;&#39;a reason drugs were unnecessary&#39;&#39;, counter to what some concerned parents might think.

Several parents (maybe eight; there were perhaps fifty kids), concerned or otherwise I couldn&#39;t say, were there.  Most kept to themselves at a back table.  I think they were the drivers, just hanging out until the kids were ready to go home.  Some mixed easily with the kids.  The kids didn&#39;t seem to mind.  The separation was strictly based on what the older people wanted to do.  I mixed with the kids and seemed to be accepted completely.  I&#39;ve been in social situations before (churches, parent teacher organizations, parties, etc.) where I knew nobody or hardly anybody when I got there and knew nobody when I left.  I was surprised to find that these kids were very outgoing and upbeat.  They moved around a lot, rather than &quot;taking a table&quot; in groups, so somebody new would plop into an open seat, whether he knew the  group or not and automatically be part of that group.  Somebody would wander away.  I was told, &quot;All goths are &#39;&#39;ADD*&#39;&#39;.  You shouldn&#39;t be offended if somebody walks away while you&#39;re talking to them.&quot; They were frank and open - genuine rather than polite.

There was a lot of touching going on.  People greeted and left by hugging and often kissing.  They sat in each others&#39; laps.  Back rubs were given casually, without ceremony.  And gender did not matter.  Boys sat in boys&#39; laps, girls sat in girls&#39; laps, as well as boy-girl mixes.  I found out that this had nothing to do with sexual orientation.  Boys who were known to be gay would smooch and flirt with their female friends.  Boys who were straight would hug their male friends and start writhing and groaning, building to a parody of orgasm.  It was a sort of acknowledging their need to be touched, and their adolescent sex drives - getting those touch needs met and laughing at their need for it.  Maybe even a parody of the adult idea that all touching is sexual at that age.  These kids seemed innocently wise in their awareness that they &#39;&#39;needed touch*&#39;&#39;, and almost disturbingly liberated in knowing that need must sometimes be met without emotional commitment.  Emotional commitment is too hard to come by.  So kisses and hugs and massages were exchanged without anything being implied or inferred.  It felt good.  It didn&#39;t need to mean more than that.

Occasionally, couples (mixed or same gender - again, no reflection on sexual orientation) danced together.  But for the most part, when someone wanted to dance, he or she went to the dance floor and danced.  Several times, there was only one person dancing.  This was obviously quite acceptable.  If anyone stared, it was because they enjoyed watching the dancer.  The boys, in particular, were very animated in their movements, which I found ironic for a culture that presented themselves as &quot;dead&quot;.  I asked Judy if it would be OK for me to bring a sketch book and sketch the dancers, and she said, &quot;People do it all the time.  They&#39;ll be flattered.&quot;

I didn&#39;t know the music.  A lot of it was loud and metallic.  Oddly, these songs would have passages in them that were almost classical - I think there was a harp pavanne in one  a- gross departure from the raucous sounds wrapped around them.  This contrast seemed to be integral to the message Ñ not a parody, but an acknowledgment that moments of serenity and introspection exist around and within the frenetic drama of life.

I found myself contrasting this goth culture with the preppie culture with which I was surrounded as a high schooler.  Preppies are generally very priviledged, with bright futures.  The girls wear subtle make-up and nice hairstyles and colors like pink, yellow and green.  The boys wear shirts with collars, and nice slacks, and are very clean and well groomed.  When they talk, they are cheerful and optimistic.  But they don&#39;t say much.  They avoid &quot;controversial&quot; subjects and &quot;improper&quot; behavior.  They are famous for &quot;air kisses&quot;, where you lean toward somebody at the shoulders and make kissing noises, but don&#39;t actually touch your lips to them.  They speak scornfully in acronyms about PDA (public displays of affection) and VPL (visible panty lines Ña major fashion faux pas.)  They are &quot;hi-bye friends&quot; with pretty much everybody, but talk people down behind their backs.  On the dance floor, they are stiff and vacant - what they describe as &quot;cool&quot;.  When I get to know preppies, I find that they are often depressed, feeling as if they are obligated to be pretentious, not free to be who they really are. Even the ones who are catty behind people&#39;s backs say that this is just another false-face they put on because it is expected, and they fear that other people, even those who pretend to like them, are rejecting them behind their own backs.

The goths seem to embrace death.  What they stand for on a deeper level though, is rejecting pretense, rejecting small talk and posturing and pretending everything is OK (which is death, Judy adds).  They feel life intensely, fully acknowledging not-belonging, anger, depression, even death. (One told me this joke:  &quot;How do you get a goth out of a tree?&quot;  The answer is &#39;&#39;&quot;Cut the rope.&quot;&#39;&#39;)  The message - and perhaps I am over-analyzing - is that life is too short to ignore loneliness and need and pain.  When you address these things, you can live more genuinely.

I found it refreshing, liberating, and oddly tender.

I got a call from Janet&#39;s kindergarten teacher today, asking me not to come along with Laurel to the class picnic, because she didn&#39;t want Laurel around the other kids. They&#39;re going to a public park, so I guess we can bloody well go if we want to. 

This has been planned for two weeks and I complied with all her requests to &quot;prepare the class.&quot; I talked to the kids. I sent photos. I showed the video. I explained the whole damn thing in fifteen minute intervals for the last week. I even &#39;&#39;brought them cookies&#39;&#39; that Janet, Laurel, and I made. 

I told that thrice-blasted nonteacher this was completely in keeping with the willful nurturing of ignorance leading to fear that I&#39;ve come to expect from Cattail Elementary. 

She suggested I bring Laurel in for show and tell one day instead. I told her there was really no point, since this exact kind of prejudice and willful ignorance was precisely why there were so few resources available for children like Laurel. She gave me an &quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that way&quot;. 

I told her that, if it eased her conscience to think this was all about my attitude, go right ahead, but there were certain realities to having my daughter denied public education for six months out of the year, or to kids being suffocated in institutions as part of their &quot;behavior intervention plan.&quot; 

I told her she obviously didn&#39;t want to educate herself; her goal was to revoke her invitation to Laurel to join them for the picnic, and she&#39;d done it. She wanted it to be OK that she&#39;d done that.

And damnit, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not&#39;&#39;. I was not nice.

So of course, the day of the picnic dawns bright and sunny. I got Janet to school with her paper bags of chocolate and marshmallow brownies. She only even ate one tiny corner &quot;to make it even-steven-leven, mommy.&quot; Of course, there is no telling if the brownies made it from the car to the classroom in one piece.

The dandelions in our yard are in the just-popped-out but not-yet-frizzed state right now, so the yard is shiny with long green grass and bright yellow pretties. Laurel lost herself in a dizzy daze, wandering from flower to petal to flower to torn flower to wind petals for over two hours this morning. 

After a while Laurel came in and pointed to the car.    She ran into Janet&#39;s room, got the barbie doll out, put it in the oven, and put it in the car.  This actually made a good deal of sense to me - Janet gets to have things in the oven and then in the car.  So should Laurel.

And I was just burning inside, that constant growl of &#39;&#39;burnt buttered anger&#39;&#39; swallowed down with a dollop of cholestrolic frustration. So off we went to Janet&#39;s picnic. 

We stopped by MacDonalds for fries, two chocolate shakes, and a big mac with cheese. Laurel just loves to dip melted cheese into a chocolate shake and lick her hands. The sugar load makes her impossible for a day or two later, but this was a special treat. Or so I told myself, which didn&#39;t dampen my heartburn one smidgen bit.

So, we get there. We stay at just the right distance - not enough to embarrass Janet, but enough to let the teacher know we are there. Laurel wants to slide down the curly slide. I go with her. She climbs the ladder, sits backwards with her legs hanging over the edges, and goes. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. And the kindergarteners, bless them, whisper to each other, pointing and scuffing their feet. &quot;That&#39;s Laurel.&quot; &quot;Her mom made the cookies.&quot; &quot;Her eyes and ears don&#39;t tell her the right stuff.&quot; &quot;Let her go first.&quot; 

They mounted guard over the slide, assuring all and sundry that they could have a turn when Laurel got tired. Because, after all, Laurel didn&#39;t know about turns. I cringed a bit at this (what mother wouldn&#39;t?) but smiled.

The teacher said nothing. But called them &#39;&#39;all in early&#39;&#39;.

SCRIPT FOR THE PERFECT REPARTE:  

TEACHER:   Why don&#39;t you just bring her in for show and tell one day? I&#39;m sure all the children will find it so educational.

&#39;&#39;SUPERMOM*&#39;&#39;:   Well, of course my dear. And tell me, just how many other human beings will you have over that day so the children can gawk? Perhaps you&#39;ll find room in your heavy schedule for an elephant man? A fat lady? Maybe I can arrange something. Better yet, maybe you&#39;d like a slave auction. Sure, why gape at something for a moment when you can own it forever?

TEACHER:   Of all the nerve! I never! If you feel that way about it, we may as well forget the whole thing.

SUPERMOM:   Does this mean that Laurel can come to the picnic like any other child? Or are we still separating children into those worthy of picnics and those relegated to show and tell?

Subject:  Something I forgot to mention at the time

Do you guys remember me being all excited about facilitated typing in Laurel&#39;s first IEP this year? And how they actually took the ideas Chris and I had been using and implemented them in the classroom?

I&#39;ve been thinking about that meeting a lot lately. And it just recently dawned on me what I should have said. (Yeah, I know, most people think of comebacks five minutes after the meeting. Me, it takes a few months. But they are good when I get them.)

Ms. Scratcherd, the new school psychologist, (whom they are sharing with six other elementary schools, so she goes, well if this is Tuesday, it must be Cattail Elementary.) Her suits are extremely professional, down to the little lace at the throat that apparently Working Woman still insists is the key to success. Anyway, at one point she turns to me and says, &quot;Well &#39;&#39;MOM&#39;&#39;, what do you think?&quot;

Now I know. I should have just said, &quot;Gee, I don&#39;t know, &#39;&#39;SHRINK&#39;&#39;, what do you think?&quot; But at the time, it didn&#39;t occur to me. Too simple, I guess. I just spouted off with the latest theory about opiod excess and gluten sensitivity that I got off the Internet last night. Which got me a big fat nowhere.

&quot;Well, MOM&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39; that idea has never been scientifically validated,&quot; she said and left muttering about something. Professional secret societies probably. I forget what.

From the Individualized Education Plan, Laurel Murphy. Last updated 8/5/96.

This semester, we are going to try facilitated typing. We will use the MacIntosh Plus in the schoolroom and the MacClassic at home. At school, Ms. Lincoln or Ms. Abbot will watch for any interest in the computer. They will ask Laurel if she wants to type. An affirmative response will be a nod or sitting at the computer. At that point, they will open up the FACILITATED TYPING EXERCISE folder and create a new document from the template. They will place their palm under Laurel&#39;s wrist, firmly, but allowing free movement. They will read aloud any words or sounds produced.

Mom will do the same at home and bring in any work on a disk. Dr. Scratchard will examine these facilitated typing exercises at the end of the semester.

It must be noted that the school&#39;s position is that this exercise will help Laurel understand the relationship between sounds and letters. We do not advocate this technique, nor do we believe it an accurate portrayal of Laurel&#39;s level of intelligence or output. The output from these exercises in no way &#39;&#39;reflect Laurel&#39;s&#39;&#39; thoughts or level of communication.

Subject:  The only thing we have to fear is ourselves

Laurel, who just turned 6 today, said one of her first words to me last night and I have not been able to sleep just thinking about it. I think those words were a dream, something you don&#39;t quite catch and then you wonder.  Did I really see that flower fly?  No, of course not.  Did that shadow really just move to catch the cat?  Nah, a trick of the light. Nothing to it.  Did I really hear Laurel say this?  No,  I was just tired.  Maybe.

First of all, you have to understand that Laurel has an extremely &#39;&#39;limited vocabulary&#39;&#39;.  She will blow &quot;waa, waa&quot; for something to drink, and may even whisper &quot;shaw, shaw&quot; for a shower.  If she is truly in the grip of some emotion (want, happiness, frustration, rage), she will belt out the tune (and occasionally the lyrics) for &quot;peanut, peanut butter.&quot;  But as for recognizable, contextual speech, there has been nothing.

Yet last night, Laurel and I were cuddling up on the sofa in the &#39;&#39;loving room*&#39;&#39; watching tv, and Janet was running around on the floor, scooting her blocks onto a dump truck and then using Modzilla to stomp the truck, the cat, and the floor.  Laurel just stared at her, then at me and then came close to my face and blew into my eyes.  I moved over and Laurel straddled my lap and faced me.  This in itself is odd, because she shies away from faces, rocking carefully and staring at the floor whenever she has to face someone.  But she looked at me and said, &quot;I scared&quot;.  Not knowing for sure if she really did speak, and if she did,  if she was actually communicating with me or just repeating something she had heard off the tv or echoing Janet&#39;s screaming dolls who were now running away from Modzilla as fast as possible, I asked her, &quot;What are you scared of, Laurel?&quot;

Immediately, without any delay whatsoever, she replied, &quot;People&quot;. She then laid her head on my shoulder and hugged me *really* tight for about 3 minutes or so.  I stared at her, unable to reply. The tv and Janet&#39;s stomping seemed unreal in the silence after this.  The soft tissue of her voice lingered in my mind like a ghost&#39;s kiss.  

Later that night, I went into her room and saw her lying rigid, eyes wide open.  In the middle of the floor were two of Janet&#39;s dolls - poised to devour the Modzilla.  Laurel did not move as I stood in the doorway, &#39;&#39;watching her staring&#39;&#39; at the moon.

Does this sound familiar to anyone at all?

The eyes see the other face behind the colors of the cd. The face and the eyes rock in sync, the same air currents of dust part for both.

The eyes stare at the other eyes. They do not move back and forth. They stay steady like dark brown mountains. They hold back the colors. They make it safe. Everything is safe.

Then the others, the human people touch the cd. Bend the light. Make the eyes move up. This is not safe. This breaks the dark mountains and the moon can come in whenever she wants to. 

The mind&#39;s soul wants the moon to stay away. The mind wants the cd safe. No, No. No, No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Stay Away No.

From:   Sarah 
Subject:   A class all unto her own
Date:   11/27/95

Janet has been in the Brownies for an entire two months and can speak of nothing else.  She knows what badges she wants to earnÑhas a list on her wall with dates and everything.  Suzie&#39;s mother, Karen, is the den mother and has the ten little girls all ecstatic over her agendas.  Already, they have learned the Tennesee waltz, &#39;&#39;tried the scottish polka*&#39;&#39;, had a lemonade sale, and made yarn octopi and &#39;&#39;god&#39;s eyes*&#39;&#39;. They have plans for learning Japanese flower arranging, going to the water works to see how pipes fit together, and riding with a &#39;&#39;policeman&#39;&#39; for a day.   

Janet says that Laurel would want to go into Girl Scouts.  She brings home some &#39;&#39;yellow and green&#39;&#39; yarn and two glued together popsicle sticks to show Laurel how to make her very own god&#39;s eye.  She takes Laurel&#39;s hand in hers and together they weave the yarn under and over, under and over. Laurel actually sits still for this for ten minutes, and snatches the half-finished god&#39;s eye out of Janet&#39;s hands.  Then she sits in the middle of the kitchen floor, trying to spin it.  Janet and I watch open mouthed as she does get a few turns from it.  

&quot;See, I told you she wanted to join the Girl Scouts.&quot;  Janet said triumphantly. Just where she made this brilliant logic leap is beyond my meager analytical skills.  So I said I&#39;d see what I could do.

I called up Karen first, and she hemmed and hawed.  I climbed the phone tree, going after one person, then another, doubling back occasionally (Call Mrs X?  But Mrs. X said to call YOU!).  After going up and down the alphabet a couple of times, I reached a kindly Mrs.  P (for Patterson).  She said that while &#39;&#39;no troop would take Laurel&#39;&#39;, we could make an official troop of one for her.  We would Laurel-ize the criteria for badges and for trips.  She could join other troops as a guest - where appropriate, where all children and their mothers agree in advance, where it would not pose any threat to anyone, where etc. where etc. 

So now Laurel is the Girl Scout Troop 001.  (We tried to make it 007, but that was already taken.)  I have the paperwork and everything all finished.  We held our first meeting, but Laurel was much more interested in the cd she was holding than the badges.  We have to find some badges that really shine.  Or that look like, act like, and taste like orange starburst candy.  Then maybe she&#39;ll notice.
